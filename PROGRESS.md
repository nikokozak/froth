# Frothy Progress

*Last updated: 2026-04-17*

This file is the thin operational note for Frothy.
The current-state block in `docs/roadmap/Frothy_Development_Roadmap_v0_1.md`
remains the authoritative live control surface.

If this file disagrees with the accepted Frothy spec, ADRs, or roadmap, this
file is wrong.

## Landed And Still Relevant

- Frothy `v0.1` is closed through M10; the dated ladder is done.
- The first embedded tool-surface tranche is now landed: Frothy no longer
  treats the accepted `v0.1` spec as the whole present-day user-facing
  ceiling, the maintained base image now ships `map`, `clamp`, `mod`, `wrap`,
  and integer `random.*` helpers plus short aliases across the maintained board
  paths, and `docs/adr/123-post-v0_1-embedded-tool-surface.md` plus
  `docs/roadmap/Frothy_Embedded_Tool_Surface_Tranche_1.md` now record that
  boundary explicitly, including the naming rule that canonical dotted
  families stay ordinary slots while bare aliases are reserved for common pure
  transforms. The default POSIX profile now carries the payload arena budget
  needed by that richer base image, and the test runner invalidates host-profile
  caches when CMake or board profile inputs change.
- The first workshop-board DRAM downsize tranche is now landed: the v4 board
  now carries an `8192`-byte heap and a `64`-frame explicit evaluator stack,
  the snapshot codec no longer keeps duplicated encode/decode tables live in
  BSS at the same time, base-slot ownership no longer costs a full pointer
  array, and `docs/roadmap/Frothy_Workshop_DRAM_Tranche_2026-04-15.md` records
  the exact baseline, scenario high-waters, byte recovery, and remaining
  payload-arena constraints.
- Spoken-ledger syntax tranche 1 is the frozen baseline for future language
  work. See `docs/spec/Frothy_Language_Spec_vNext.md`,
  `docs/spec/Frothy_Surface_Syntax_Proposal_vNext.md`, and
  `docs/adr/114-next-stage-structural-surface-and-recovery-shape.md`.
- The first workspace/image-flow tranche is closed as a doc-only,
  slot-bundle-first boundary. See
  `docs/adr/115-first-workspace-image-flow-tranche.md` and
  `docs/roadmap/Frothy_Workspace_Image_Flow_Tranche_1.md`.
- The direct-control surface, helper/editor path, and runtime hardening
  tranches are already landed and are no longer the unclear part of the repo
  story.
- The publishability audit is now landed at
  `docs/audit/Frothy_Repo_Audit_2026-04.md`; it now serves as the reference
  record for the landed publishability reset rather than as a future cleanup
  ledger.
- The Frothy CLI/install rename tranche is now landed: repo, product, docs,
  release assets, installed CLI, and repo-local checkout build all use the
  Frothy-owned `frothy` / `frothy-cli` names, while VS Code keeps only narrow
  legacy `froth` discovery fallback during the transition.
- The VS Code live-edit loop now separates last-run and pinned-run targets:
  `Run Binding` records a zero-arity `name:` call for `Rerun Last Form`,
  `Pin Run Binding` records a fixed `name:` call for repeated testing after
  edits, and definition or top-level value sends do not overwrite the
  remembered run target.
- The VS Code board recovery path no longer strands the editor in `running`:
  control-session prompt acquisition sends the emergency Ctrl-C much earlier,
  helper disconnect can close a serial transport even while an eval owns the
  operation lock, pending helper connects no longer block later disconnect
  recovery, full-file send interrupts and supersedes stale long evals, stale
  helper completions cannot clobber a fresh session, remembered serial ports
  fall back to discovery when stale, and `dangerous.wipe` now requires an
  explicit editor confirmation. The VS Code board proof now exercises
  interrupt, Send File while running, and disconnect while running through the
  real extension host.
- The VS Code stale-session escape hatch is now explicit rather than inferred
  from serial noise: `Frothy: Force Reconnect` hard-restarts the editor helper
  and reconnects, the running status item points at that command for reset or
  power-cycle recovery, and unsettled whole-file sends offer it without replaying
  the file across the fresh session.
- This control-surface repair tranche is landed: `PROGRESS.md` and
  `TIMELINE.md` are thin again, `the repo guide` supports targeted work, and the
  forward queue now lives in one short roadmap note plus Frothy ADR-116.
- The workshop-operational queue now leads: clean-machine validation,
  room-side hardware/recovery prep, and one recorded measured rehearsal pass;
  the evaluator frame-arena ownership revisit is deferred until Frothy
  intentionally grows multiple live runtime instances or another re-entrant
  evaluator owner.
- The first workshop base-image board/library cut is landed: `millis()` and
  `gpio.read()` are now native base slots, the preflashed workshop helper
  library is seeded as base image and survives `dangerous.wipe`, and the M10 proof
  ladder now covers `blink`, `animate`, GPIO helpers, and `adc.percent`.
  Reference: `docs/adr/121-workshop-base-image-board-library-surface.md`.
- The Frothy-native TM1629 workshop board cut is now landed:
  `esp32-devkit-v4-game-board` ships a maintained TM1629 C runtime plus
  baked-in `tm1629.raw.*`, `tm1629.*`, and `matrix.*` base-image surfaces;
  board base ownership now comes from a captured install-time registry rather
  than hard-coded slot-name allowlists; and the host proof ladder now includes
  direct TM1629 runtime tests plus a POSIX sub-build smoke for the new board.
  Reference: `docs/adr/119-tm1629-board-base-surface-and-registry.md`.
- The post-review TM1629 cleanup tranche is now landed: parser, shell, and
  snapshot name validation share one Frothy grammar for `!`, `@`, and `?`;
  `tm1629.raw.init` now fails on invalid pins or failed pin-mode setup instead
  of silently succeeding; the payload-fragmentation proof scales with
  board-configured arena size; the ESP-IDF v4 board target now carries its
  required console defaults, links the TM1629 runtime, honors board.json
  runtime capacities, builds from the current repo, flashes on
  `/dev/cu.usbserial-0001`, and answers direct `matrix.*` / `tm1629.raw.*`
  control smoke on hardware.
- The workshop implementation tranche is now closed on `main`: the delivery,
  inspection, workshop base-image, readability-language, and records cuts have
  all survived the local proof ladder plus repeated review cycles.
- The first detailed Friday workshop run spec is now checked in at
  `docs/roadmap/Frothy_Workshop_Run_Spec_2026-04-17.md`; it freezes the lesson
  arc, `Get Home` inspection puzzle, the shared `starter.frothy` scaffold, required helper
  surface, persistence teaching points, and rehearsal checklist.
- The v4 workshop-helper tranche is now landed on the maintained proto-board
  path: `esp32-devkit-v4-game-board` base now carries the generic workshop
  helpers plus `grid.*`, `joy.*`, and `knob.*`; board-configured Frothy
  capacities are driven from `board.json` on both host and ESP-IDF builds; the
  Friday workshop docs now describe the real v4 matrix/knob/joystick surface;
  and real-device proof on the mounted board froze the semantic joystick map to
  `left=JOY_1`, `click=JOY_2`, `down=JOY_3`, `up=JOY_4`, `right=JOY_6`, with
  `dangerous.wipe` restoring those base-owned pin slots on hardware.
- The first explicit evaluator-frame-stack tranche is now landed on `main`:
  `CALL`, `IF`, `WHILE`, `SEQ`, and required compound expression paths run
  through a bounded explicit frame stack instead of recursive evaluator entry,
  prompt-facing `record ...` forms now match the landed
  parser/evaluator/snapshot record surface, and the focused host proof slice
  now includes both the eval stack-budget tripwire and shell record coverage.
- The evaluator stack-overflow regression found by a simple ESP32 `boot` loop
  is therefore no longer defended only by compile-time frame-size hygiene; the
  explicit evaluator-frame-stack tranche is the maintained path, and the
  remaining bounded frame-arena ownership revisit is now deferred until
  multi-instance runtime work makes shared ownership matter.
- The ESP32 shell-path overflow on multiline `in` / `cond` / `case` definitions
  is fixed in the current tree by removing a 1KB rewrite buffer from
  `frothy_shell_run()`'s task stack, widening the stack-budget proof to cover
  parser/shell entry paths, and restoring the maintained ESP-IDF main-task
  stack setting to 8192 bytes in `targets/esp-idf/sdkconfig`.
- The host serial control path is now pruned of the legacy raw-`HELLO`
  discovery probe, the maintained macOS CLI transport uses the direct raw
  termios path that actually survives ESP32 prompt/control handoff, and the
  Frothy local connect build cache no longer collides with inherited Froth's
  stale `local-build` directory.
- The workshop release/install surface is now truthful in-repo: `README.md`,
  `docs/guide/Frothy_Workshop_Install_Quickstart.md`,
  `tools/package-release.sh`, and the VS Code docs all agree on the promised
  attendee path of released CLI assets, matching VSIX, and preflashed
  `esp32-devkit-v4-game-board` hardware.
- The workshop product shape is now simpler and single-sourced in-repo:
  `workshop/starter.frothy` is the sanctioned public starter scaffold,
  `frothy doctor` no longer treats source-build tools as attendee blockers,
  and the manual release workflow no longer promises an attendee firmware
  artifact that this tranche does not publish.
- Board-selected build input is now truthful again: host and ESP-IDF builds
  resolve board-owned extra C sources from the selected board declaration
  instead of carrying hardcoded TM1629 linkage in the global build lists, so
  the default v1 board path stays a plain base Frothy image unless a board
  explicitly declares more.
- The repo-checkout CLI selection path is now explicit again: `--target`
  means platform, `--board` means board, manifest projects ignore those flags
  with an explicit note instead of a hard error, legacy repo build/flash
  force-clean sticky target/board caches when selection flags are passed, and
  real-device proof now goes back through `frothy flash` rather than raw
  `idf.py` for the maintained repo-side flash path.
- The v4 workshop base-image seed regression from source comments is fixed:
  the C parser now treats backslash line comments as whitespace, matching the
  existing CLI source splitter, and the `esp32-devkit-v4-game-board` base image
  boots with the `puzzle.*` helpers present.
- The attendee-facing naming and recovery story is now explicit on the
  maintained Frothy path: Frothy owns the product/docs/editor/install identity,
  the default CLI home is `~/.frothy` with `FROTHY_HOME` override, Frothy now
  creates that home on demand instead of consulting legacy `~/.froth`,
  whole-file editor send attempts control `reset` before replay and marks the
  session degraded when the user explicitly chooses `Send Anyway` after reset is
  unavailable, and the control proof ladder now re-checks recovery on the real
  ESP32 path.
- The workshop editor/install surface is back in sync with the manifest:
  attendee docs now name the `NikolaiKozak.frothy` Marketplace listing, the
  editor-host smoke derives the extension id from `tools/vscode/package.json`,
  and the workshop ops proof checks that docs and manifest stay aligned.
- `esp32-devkit-v1` and `esp32-devkit-v4-game-board` remain accepted board
  models in the repo; the workshop promise is simply narrower and currently
  centered on the mounted preflashed v4 board.
- The workshop-operational slice is now concrete in-repo without widening the
  product surface: `README.md` points at one minimal front door,
  `docs/guide/Frothy_Workshop_Quick_Reference.md` keeps the in-room prompt and
  recovery path short, `docs/guide/Frothy_Workshop_Clean_Machine_Validation.md`
  freezes the promised clean-machine checklist,
  `boards/esp32-devkit-v4-game-board/WORKSHOP.md` holds the room-side kit and
  reflash card, and
  `docs/roadmap/Frothy_Workshop_Rehearsal_Closeout_2026-04-14.md` carries the
  checked-in rehearsal status note plus the focused
  `sh tools/frothy/proof.sh workshop-v4 <PORT>` real-device proof command.
- The remaining manual workshop gates stay explicit: separate clean-machine
  passes on the promised platforms and physical room pack-out are still exit
  steps, not work that prose can claim complete; the focused v4 mounted-board
  smoke is now recorded separately from any broader room rehearsal.
- The full publishability reset is now landed on `main`: stale
  proof artifacts are archived under `docs/archive/`, Frothy-facing
  naming/packaging are normalized, release packaging no longer needs Python,
  release CI uses the maintained VS Code host-smoke lane, firmware manifest
  parsing/ordering/validation and artifact path checks are centralized under
  the maintained Go surface, the default proof surface is back to `C` + `Go`
  + `Shell` with explicit `Node` and hardware-only `Python` exceptions, and
  the retained Froth substrate boundary is explicit in code and docs.

## Remaining Gates

- Workshop-operational closeout is now the active gate:
  clean-machine validation and room-side hardware/recovery prep still need to
  be executed, and one complete recorded rehearsal pass still needs to be
  captured; the focused v4 workshop-board hardware smoke is now recorded.
- The evaluator frame-arena ownership revisit is deferred: the explicit
  evaluator-frame-stack tranche is landed, and the remaining shared-ownership
  question does not block the maintained single-runtime path until Frothy
  intentionally grows multiple live runtime instances or another re-entrant
  evaluator owner.
- Workspace/image flow remains intentionally deferred and single-sourced in
  `docs/roadmap/Frothy_Workspace_Image_Flow_Tranche_1.md`.
- See `TIMELINE.md` for the live movable queue and
  `docs/roadmap/Frothy_Post_v0_1_Priorities_And_Workshop_Prep.md` for the
  rationale behind that order.
