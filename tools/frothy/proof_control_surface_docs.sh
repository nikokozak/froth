- Cut 2: host-only slot-bundle inspection or generation in the CLI project
  layer
- Cut 2 held boundary: respect the stable boundary record above; keep the
  work on top of resolved source plus existing derived `.froth-build` outputs
- Cut 2 host-side proof bar: `make test-cli && make test-cli-local && make test-integration`
- Cut 2 promotion gate: move past Cut 2 only if inspection/generation proves
  useful by making later workspace/image-flow work smaller or clearer
- Cut 2 promotion gate: if Cut 2 does not buy that clarity, stop and tighten
  the design docs instead of widening the implementation
- Cut 3: later apply/load growth only after Cut 2 proves useful
- Cut 3 held boundary: respect the stable boundary record above
- Cut 3 held boundary: any live apply composes with the existing helper/control
  path as `reset + replay`
- Cut 3 host-side proof bar: `make test-all && sh tools/frothy/proof_f1_control_smoke.sh --host-only`
- Cut 2/3 sign-off bar: host-side proof bar plus a real-device sanity proof on
  a connected ESP32-class target before sign-off
