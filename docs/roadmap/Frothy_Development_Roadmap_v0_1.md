# Frothy Development Roadmap

Status: Accepted working roadmap
Date: 2026-04-09
Depends on: `docs/spec/Frothy_Language_Spec_v0_1.md`
Supersedes: initial Frothy execution-plan draft

## 1. Purpose

This roadmap is the working plan for turning Froth into Frothy.

It is meant to be:

- executable,
- trackable,
- reviewable,
- and realistic for one developer inside the thesis timebox.

This is not a vision memo.
It is a sequencing and control document.

## 2. Current State

This block is the live control surface for repo status.

Current milestone: `evaluator execution-stack hardening`
Today's goal: accept the explicit evaluator-frame-stack ADR, make it the
immediate live priority, and prepare the first implementation tranche that
removes recursive IR execution from the embedded runtime path
Next artifact: Frothy ADR-118 plus the first evaluator-trampoline tranche for
`CALL`, `IF`, `WHILE`, and `SEQ` over an explicit frame stack
Blocked by: none
Next proof command: `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build && ./build/frothy_eval_tests && sh tools/frothy/proof_eval_stack_budget.sh`
Slip against plan: the workshop-operational queue was intentionally preempted
after an ESP32 `boot` loop exposed that ordinary embedded looping still
depended on hidden C stack depth through the recursive evaluator; that runtime
boundary now outranks attendee-polish follow-ons
Cut candidate if slip persists: keep the workshop-facing install/docs queue
narrow, land the explicit evaluator-frame-stack tranche first, and defer
broader publishability cleanup plus extra surface work until ordinary looping
is explicit, bounded, and re-proved on device

## 3. Operating Rules

### 3.1 Design rules

Every milestone should be judged by four questions:

1. Does this keep the language core small?
2. Does this preserve the live image / persistence story?
3. Does this reuse working Froth substrate instead of rebuilding it?
4. Is this realistic inside the thesis timebox?

If the answer to any of these is no, the work should be cut, deferred, or
reframed.

### 3.2 Implementation rules

Bias toward:

- simplicity,
- efficiency,
- robustness,
- elegance,
- literal reuse of working code,
- and visible end-to-end progress.

Avoid:

- speculative abstractions,
- major frameworks,
- semantic drift before ADRs,
- and “we can optimize it later” designs that already violate the core model.

### 3.3 Tracking legend

Use these markers when updating the roadmap:

- `[ ]` not started
- `[~]` in progress
- `[x]` done
- `[!]` blocked or decision needed

### 3.4 Daily cadence

- update the current-state block once per work session
- only one milestone may be `[~]` at a time
- every `[~]` milestone must name one next artifact and one proof command
- every `[!]` milestone must name the blocking decision
- if a milestone slips beyond its max days, apply the cut ladder explicitly

## 4. End State For Frothy v0.1

Frothy v0.1 is considered real when all of these are true:

- [x] A host REPL can define `Code`, cells stores, and top-level values.
- [x] Redefining a top-level code slot changes behavior seen by old callers.
- [x] `save`, `restore`, and `wipe` work on the overlay image.
- [x] `words()` lists names, `see()` inspects overlay `Code`, and minimal
  `core()` output is available.
- [x] Ctrl-C cancels pending multiline input, interrupts running evaluation at
  safe points, and returns to a usable prompt.
- [x] A small ESP32 hardware sketch works end-to-end.
- [x] The public language model is no longer stack-centric.

## 5. Primary Workstreams

There are six workstreams.

### 5.1 Repo and release separation

Goal:

- prevent the Frothy fork from publishing as Froth by accident.

### 5.2 Language definition

Goal:

- lock the semantic core before implementation sprawls.

### 5.3 Runtime substrate adaptation

Goal:

- reuse slot table, heap, boot, snapshot, FFI, and transport infrastructure
  while replacing the language layer.

### 5.4 Language front end and evaluator

Goal:

- build parser, IR, tree-walk evaluator, and image semantics.

### 5.5 Persistence and inspection

Goal:

- preserve Froth’s strongest property: transparent persistent live images.

### 5.6 Hardware proof

Goal:

- prove the language on real device work, not just host demos.

## 6. Milestone Table

Assumption:
these target dates record the completed v0.1 path that began on 2026-04-09.

Exit criteria:

- Ctrl-C cancels pending multiline input and interrupts running evaluation at

  REPL expression succeeds, `words()` works from the host REPL, `see()`
  matches canonical semantics for overlay `Code`, `core()` exposes minimal
  normalized IR, `slotInfo()` reports binding metadata, and `boot` runs before
  the prompt when bound to `Code`.

### M9. Board FFI Surface

Purpose:

- make the board-facing hardware surface natural in Frothy.

### M10. Hardware Proof

Purpose:

- prove the language on actual device work.

Checklist:

- [x] blink sketch
- [x] persistent boot behavior
- [x] one stateful sketch using cells

Deliverables:

- [x] blink program
- [x] boot persistence program
- [x] cells-based stateful demo
- [x] `tools/frothy/proof_m10_smoke.sh`
- [x] `tools/frothy/proof_m10_esp32_smoke.py`
- [x] board instructions or proof transcript

Suggested proofs:

- [x] LED blink with configurable period
- [x] saved boot behavior on power cycle
- [x] four-sample ADC capture stored in cells

Verification:

- [x] board proof scripts or manual transcripts captured
- [x] proof command: `./tools/frothy/proof_m10_smoke.sh <PORT>`

Exit criteria:

- ESP32 runs blink, boot persistence, and one cells-based stateful sketch end-to-end.

Closeout:

- Closed on 2026-04-12 with a checked-in transcript at
  `docs/archive/proofs/m10_esp32_proof_transcript.txt`.
- The first live-board failure on 2026-04-12 was not an ESP-IDF visibility
  problem after all; the real runtime-side issue was avoidable ESP32 main-task
  stack pressure from Frothy shell-local line buffers, compounded by a device
  proof runner that assumed POSIX-style GPIO trace output.
- The fix stayed within the accepted boundary: move the shell line buffers out
  of the task stack, harden the device runner's prompt handling, and validate
  the actual ESP32-observable behavior without widening the Frothy board
  surface.

### Follow-On Queue. Transport, Runtime, Tooling, Workspace

Purpose:

- move from a proven `v0.1` core to a daily-usable Frothy system without
  widening semantics carelessly or rebuilding the old Froth host stack.

Operational label:

- `queued follow-on only`

Pending follow-on categories:

1. FFI boundary quality and porting discipline
2. small useful core library growth
3. robust string support
4. measured performance tightening
5. direct-control tooling improvements
6. deferred workspace/image-flow queue

Detailed queue, workshop gate, and deferred workspace/image-flow staging:

- `docs/roadmap/Frothy_Post_v0_1_Priorities_And_Workshop_Prep.md`
- `docs/roadmap/Frothy_Workspace_Image_Flow_Tranche_1.md`

Already landed in this follow-on tranche:

1. urgent transport slice 1
2. runtime hardening
3. syntax tranche 1
4. VS Code plugin merge and alignment
5. immediate control hardening + `RESET`
6. control-surface repair and workshop-prep note

#### Control-surface repair and workshop prep

Status:

- landed on 2026-04-13 as a docs/control-surface repair tranche

Why now:

- `PROGRESS.md` and `TIMELINE.md` had drifted from thin control docs into
  narrative status streams
- `the repo guide` still implied a heavyweight full-session cold-start ritual even
  for targeted work
- the repo already had real forward-direction docs in `vNext` and the accepted
  ADR stack, but the post-`v0.1` queue was not surfaced as one truthful
  workshop-facing story

Approach:

- keep the accepted `v0.1` spec, Frothy ADRs, and roadmap current-state block
  authoritative
- keep `PROGRESS.md` as a short operational note rather than a changelog
- keep `TIMELINE.md` as a movable checkbox ledger rather than a narrative
  slip diary
- keep `the repo guide` targeted-work-first and require the broader read pass only
  when the task is broad, stale, or policy/semantics-touching
- surface the post-`v0.1` priority stack and 2026-04-16 workshop gate in one
  short roadmap note instead of scattering them across status prose

Closeout:

- `docs/roadmap/Frothy_Post_v0_1_Priorities_And_Workshop_Prep.md` now carries
  the near-term priority stack and workshop gate
- Frothy ADR-116 records the thin-control-doc and targeted-session policy
- `README.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, `TIMELINE.md`, and `the repo guide` now point at the
  same live story

Proof:

- `sh tools/frothy/proof_control_surface_docs.sh`

#### Next-stage language definition

Status:

- landed on 2026-04-13 as a doc-only closeout on top of the frozen
  spoken-ledger syntax tranche 1 baseline

Why now:

- syntax tranche 1 improved readability, but did not close the main remaining
  expressiveness gaps
- the next language work should be written down before runtime scope widens
- modules and records need to be placed explicitly in Frothy's slot-and-image
  model before they leak in piecemeal through tooling or library experiments
- the language also needs an explicit in-language recovery story for ordinary
  library code, not only shell-level recovery at the top-level boundary

Approach:

- keep the accepted `v0.1` spec authoritative for current behavior
- keep spoken-ledger syntax tranche 1 explicit in the live draft:
  `name is expr`, `here name is expr`, `set place to expr`, `to` / `fn with`,
  bracket blocks, `:` calls plus `call expr with ...`, `repeat`, `when`,
  `unless`, `and`, `or`, prompt verbs, and prompt-only bare simple-call sugar
- keep that first slice parser-lowered onto the existing canonical IR,
  evaluator, and snapshot machinery
- keep records, modules, `cond`/`case`, Frothy-native `try/catch`, and
  restricted top-level binding/place designators in the draft, but do not
  widen runtime semantics for them yet
- keep recovery terminology honest: top-level shell/control/boot recovery is
  current reality, and the next in-language `try/catch` surface must stay
  explicitly non-transactional and narrower than Froth's old global catch
- do not widen runtime semantics from discussion alone; land the draft spec and
  ADR before implementation work

Closeout:

- `docs/spec/Frothy_Language_Spec_vNext.md` now treats spoken-ledger syntax
  tranche 1 as the frozen baseline and keeps only records, modules,
  `cond`/`case`, Frothy-native `try/catch`, and binding/place designators in
  draft
- `docs/spec/Frothy_Surface_Syntax_Proposal_vNext.md` now keeps `in prefix`
  draft-only, narrows ordinary-code `@name`, and stops narrating already-landed
  parser and shell work as pending
- Frothy ADR-114 records the chosen remaining draft shape
- no parser, evaluator, snapshot, or control-session semantics widened in this
  closeout

Proof:

- `make test-all && sh tools/frothy/proof_next_stage_docs.sh`

#### Workspace/image-flow tranche 1

Status:

- landed on 2026-04-13 as a doc-only closeout

Why now:

- the helper/editor/control surfaces are finally small enough to define the
  first artifact without rebuilding the old host stack
- the current repo already has one source-first apply path through
  `resolve-source`, `.froth-build/runtime.frothy`, and direct control replay
- Frothy still needs a small library and workspace/image flow story, but not
  one that invents a loader, registry, daemon, or IR-first transport

Approach:

- keep the accepted `v0.1` spec and the landed control/helper/editor/runtime
  slices authoritative for current behavior
- freeze the first useful artifact as a host-local named slot bundle rather
  than as an on-device image format or public IR exchange
- define the slot bundle around explicit owned slot names and owned dotted slot
  prefixes plus one resolved runtime source payload
- keep `.froth-build/runtime.frothy` as a derived host path convenience rather
  than a frozen bundle field
- keep live apply on the existing direct control `RESET` plus replay path,
  where `RESET` means live reset to the current base image and not persisted
  overlay clearing
- keep `wipe()` as the separate persisted-overlay clearing operation
- keep persistent seed/apply as the future bundle-oriented
  `reset-to-base + replay + save()` model for build/flash workflows only,
  while the checked-in build/flash paths currently start a fresh runtime or
  freshly flashed firmware before replay plus `save()`
- record the current `reset + eval` versus `wipe()` whole-file-send drift as
  implementation debt instead of widening this tranche to fix it
- do not add helper commands, editor UI, manifest keys, kernel load requests,
  or any new workspace/image-loading protocol

Closeout:

- Frothy ADR-115 records the slot-bundle-first, docs-only tranche decision
- `docs/roadmap/Frothy_Workspace_Image_Flow_Tranche_1.md` freezes the artifact
  shape, current constraints, collision zones, and deferred queue ownership for
  any later resumed cuts
- no parser, evaluator, snapshot, helper, editor, manifest, or control-session
  semantics widen in this closeout

Proof:

- `sh tools/frothy/proof_control_surface_docs.sh`

Did not widen in this slice:

- no daemon
- no PTY layer
- no shared-owner session broker
- no registry or package surface
- no helper or control-session command growth
- no manifest schema change
- no on-device loader or IR capsule transport

#### CLI naming alignment

Status:

- landed on 2026-04-13 as a docs/tooling-notes tranche

Why now:

- the language-definition docs are now tight enough that naming cleanup can
  proceed against a stable control surface
- repo-local `froth-cli`, release-time `froth`, and intended global `frothy`
  still read as separate truths in executable-adjacent docs and tooling notes
- the repo needs one explicit Frothy-first naming note before broader release
  or discovery cleanup continues

Approach:

- keep runtime, transport, and language semantics unchanged
- align repo-control docs and executable-adjacent notes around one explicit
  Frothy-first CLI identity
- preserve current binaries and proof paths where names remain transitional
- avoid implicit renames without the matching control-doc update

Closeout:

- `README.md`, local build labels, release tooling notes, and VS Code CLI
  discovery/config wording now explain the current `froth-cli` /
  release-time `froth` / intended global `frothy` split in one place
- no binaries, tarball contents, formula install targets, CLI help text,
  discovery order, or editor command ids changed

Proof:

- `make test-all && rg -n 'repo-local \`froth-cli\`' README.md && rg -n 'release-time \`froth\`' README.md && rg -n 'intended global \`frothy\`' README.md && rg -n 'landed on 2026-04-13 as a docs/tooling-notes tranche' docs/roadmap/Frothy_Development_Roadmap_v0_1.md && rg -n 'first CLI naming-alignment artifact is landed' PROGRESS.md && rg -n '\`CLI naming alignment\`: landed on 2026-04-13 as the first truthful' TIMELINE.md`

#### Immediate control hardening + `RESET`

Status:

- landed on 2026-04-12 on top of the merged VS Code helper/control baseline

Approach:

- centralize builtin metadata so base install, inspect behavior, and shell
  output suppression stop carrying separate truths
- stream or chunk `WORDS` and `SEE` replies instead of forcing them into one
  `FROTH_LINK_MAX_PAYLOAD` value frame
- make malformed control-session requests fail explicitly without widening the
  transport shape
- land `RESET_REQ = 0x07` with reset-to-base-image semantics, structured reset
  payloads, and stale-firmware fallback through `reset_unavailable`
- add the missing startup regression for bad-arity `boot` so the accepted
  `boot()` story stays explicit and non-bricking

Proof:

- `make test-all && make bench-frothy && tools/frothy/proof_f1_control_smoke.sh --host-only`
- targeted regressions cover bad-arity `boot` startup and oversized inspect
  replies

Did not widen in this slice:

- no daemon
- no PTY layer
- no shared-owner session broker
- `save` / `restore` / `wipe` / `core` / `slotInfo` remain helper-side `EVAL`
  wrappers
- no workspace/image-loading protocol

#### Urgent transport slice 1

Why first:

- future editor and CLI work should not grow on the inherited fragile control
  path
- the highest-risk gotchas live at session entry, output delivery, interrupt,
  detach, and prompt recovery boundaries
- one broad end-to-end slice can prove the architecture without rebuilding the
  old daemon stack

Approach:

- enter structured mode from the raw prompt with `.control`
- keep `.control` as shell metacommand, not persisted language surface
- make the session exclusive and framed until `DETACH` or port close
- support `HELLO`, `EVAL`, `WORDS`, and `SEE` in the first slice
- emit structured `OUTPUT`, `VALUE`, `ERROR`, `INTERRUPTED`, and `IDLE` events
- preserve raw `Ctrl-C` as the emergency interrupt path in both raw and control
  modes
- return cleanly to the raw prompt after `DETACH`, interrupt, or disconnect
- ship one tiny direct host tool that opens the port itself and exercises the
  session without any daemon

Why this slice is intentionally broad:

- `HELLO` proves session entry and framing
- `EVAL` proves the hot path the editor cares about
- `WORDS` and `SEE` prove that inspection actions do not need REPL scraping
- structured events prove that output and errors do not need mixed raw traffic
- `DETACH` plus prompt recovery prove the mode switch is reversible
- the tiny host tool proves the protocol is usable without hidden infrastructure

Proof:

- host proof: direct tool enters `.control`, runs `HELLO`, `EVAL`, `WORDS`,
  `SEE`, receives structured events, detaches, and sees the raw prompt again
- device proof: the same flow works on ESP32 without daemon ownership
- `Ctrl-C` interrupts evaluation inside the session and still returns to a
  usable prompt
- raw REPL attach still behaves normally when no control session is active

Do not add in this slice:

- no daemon
- no PTY passthrough
- no shared-owner session broker
- no image-loading or workspace protocol
- no attempt to multiplex a human console and structured control at the same
  time

#### Syntax tranche 1

Status:

- landed on 2026-04-12 on top of the runtime-hardening baseline, closing the
  parallel parser + shell rollout under the accepted `v0.1` surface

Why second:

- it is mostly parser and shell work
- it makes Frothy read like its accepted lexical model sooner
- it does not require new IR or evaluator semantics
- it should land immediately after the urgent transport slice, not after larger
  workspace work

Approach:

- add `here`
- add top-level `name(args) = expr`
- add top-level `name(args) { block }`
- add `boot { block }`
- add bare REPL command sugar for `words`, `save`, `restore`, `wipe`,
  `see @name`, `core @name`, and `info @name`
- keep the accepted `v0.1` forms valid during rollout

Proof:

- parser coverage for the new top-level forms and `boot { ... }`
- shell continuation coverage after `=`, trailing operators, and pending
  top-level heads
- `make test` and `ctest --test-dir build -R 'frothy_parser|frothy_eval'`

#### Runtime hardening

Status:

- landed on 2026-04-12 with fixed
  `FROTHY_EVAL_VALUE_CAPACITY=256`, fixed `FROTHY_OBJECT_CAPACITY=128`,
  `make bench-frothy`, and checked-in notes at
  `docs/roadmap/F1_Runtime_Hardening_Benchmark_Notes.md`
- this slice bounds evaluator scratch and object/free-span metadata only; text
  bytes and cloned IR program bodies remain separate bounded-memory follow-on
  work

Why third:

- current eval still pays obvious hot-path costs
- the next performance pass should be measured, not guessed

Approach:

- check in a narrow benchmark harness for arithmetic, call dispatch, slot
  access, snapshot save/restore, and narrow FFI loops
- remove per-call heap churn where possible by reusing call frames and argument
  buffers under explicit fixed capacities instead of elastic growth
- measure before and after every hot-path change
- keep the tree-walk evaluator and current value model while hardening

Proof:

- new benchmark target runs on host
- existing eval, snapshot, and FFI tests remain green
- no benchmark work widens the public semantic surface

#### Local helper baseline

Why next after the landed hardening slice:

- the merged VS Code plugin now proves the helper/control path, but the helper
  is still too editor-owned
- flashing, new-project creation, and file send/apply should sit on the landed
  direct-control path rather than revive old daemon assumptions
- CLI and editor flows should converge on one maintained manager/session stack

Approach:

- reuse the landed `frothycontrol` manager/session surface across helper and
  CLI workflows
- support flashing, new-project scaffolding, and file send/apply workflows
- keep it host-local and direct-session-first
- avoid hidden background services or ownership brokers

Proof:

- helper can flash a target, scaffold a minimal project, and send/apply a file
  through a checked-in smoke path
- helper works on host without requiring the old Python session layer
- one maintained smoke covers helper plus kernel control together

#### VS Code plugin merge and alignment

Status:

- landed on 2026-04-12 on the maintained helper-owned control-session path

Approach:

- merge the local VS Code plugin work onto the single-owner control path
- keep helper and plugin responsibilities explicit instead of reintroducing a
  daemon split
- use the plugin merge to validate the helper command surface and control-event
  shape

Proof:

- the merged plugin can drive the maintained helper/control surface on host
- no mixed raw/framed ownership or daemon broker is reintroduced

## 7. Suggested Execution Order

The critical path is:

1. M0
2. M1 + M2
3. M3
4. M3a
5. M4
6. M5
7. M6
8. M7
9. M8
10. M9
11. M10
12. follow-on queue: urgent transport slice 1, runtime hardening, syntax
    tranche 1, VS Code plugin merge/alignment, immediate control hardening
    plus `RESET`, local helper broadening, and workspace/image-flow tranche 1
    are landed; CLI naming alignment is now also landed, and the deferred
    workspace/image-flow queue is single-sourced in
    `docs/roadmap/Frothy_Workspace_Image_Flow_Tranche_1.md`

Do not swap M7 and M9 unless forced.
Persistence is too central to Frothy’s identity to leave until the end.

## 8. Timebox Cut Ladder

If milestones slip, cut in this order:

1. If M4 slips:
   - keep one-precedence operators only
   - cut parser niceties before touching semantics
2. If M5 slips:
   - keep named-call-only `v0.1`
   - cut nonessential introspection before touching rebinding
3. If M7 slips:
   - cut extra inspection polish before cutting persistence
4. If M9 slips:
   - keep only `gpio.mode`, `gpio.write`, `ms`, and one input primitive
5. If M10 slips:
   - keep exactly the three proof programs and cut all demo breadth
6. If the follow-on queue slips:
   - keep the urgent transport slice and the landed runtime baseline
   - defer helper polish and workspace/image-loading work before reopening
     transport or runtime scope
7. If transport work slips:
   - keep raw REPL plus a short-lived direct session tool
   - do not add daemon, PTY, or shared-owner machinery as a stopgap

## 9. Risk Register

| Risk | Trigger | Impact | Immediate mitigation | Fallback cut | Review date |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 Parser/IR delay | M4 not complete by day 2 | blocks all runtime work | keep grammar minimal | cut parser niceties | Gate B |
| R2 Evaluator churn | M5 needs refactor for rebinding | burns time twice | keep stable-slot semantics inside M5 from the start | cut nonessential call flexibility | Gate B |
| R3 Cells bloat | M6 grows beyond fixed top-level storage | semantic sprawl | keep `cells(n)` top-level-only | cut helper surface | Gate C |
| R4 Snapshot rewrite overruns | M7 not done on time | loses Frothy identity | keep walk shallow and slot-owned | cut extra inspection polish | Gate C |
| R5 FFI drift | M9 starts redesigning native ABI deeply | late subsystem rewrite | reuse current Froth entrypoints internally | postpone value-oriented native ABI cleanup | Gate D |
| R6 Fork identity tangle | M1 incomplete when coding starts | accidental release confusion | block deeper implementation until fixed | stop release work entirely | Gate A |
| R7 Syntax rollout drifts into semantics churn | vNext work starts inventing new execution rules | reopens the accepted core | keep rollout as parser/shell desugaring only | stop after syntax tranche 1 | Gate D |
| R8 Transport replacement grows daemon features back | host work starts recreating shared ownership or mux logic | repeats Froth fragility in smaller clothes | keep single-owner direct session per ADR-110 and the urgent slice scope | fall back to raw REPL plus direct scripted control | Gate D |

## 10. Review Gates

Before moving past these points, pause and review.

### Gate A: After M2

Questions:

- is the core still small?
- are the ADRs enough to constrain the runtime?

### Gate B: After M5

Questions:

- does the evaluator still feel elegant?
- has `Code` remained non-capturing and comprehensible?

### Gate C: After M8

Questions:

- does persistence remain transparent?
- can `see` and snapshot format survive later optimization changes?

### Gate D: After M10 and the first follow-on tranche

Questions:

- does the urgent transport slice already feel smaller and safer than the
  inherited control path?
- does the new syntax make Frothy read like its accepted model without adding
  semantics churn?
- are hot-path costs now measured and visibly reduced?
- is the new control transport staying smaller and more legible than inherited
  Froth's daemon and mux stack as tools start to use it?

## 11. Immediate Follow-On Steps

If implementation resumed today, the next steps should be:

- [x] land urgent transport slice 1 from ADR-110: `.control`, `DETACH`,
  `HELLO`, `EVAL`, `WORDS`, `SEE`, and structured events
- [x] ship one tiny direct host tool that opens the serial port itself, enters
  control mode, runs the first slice commands, and exits cleanly
- [x] add host and device smoke coverage for session entry, interrupt, detach,
  and prompt recovery
- [x] land syntax tranche 1 exactly as described in
  `docs/spec/Frothy_Surface_Syntax_Proposal_vNext.md`
- [x] add a checked-in benchmark target and record current arithmetic, call,
  slot, snapshot, and FFI baselines
- [x] remove per-call heap churn in eval without changing the semantic model
- [x] prove that raw REPL and structured control can coexist as separate modes
  without daemon ownership
- [x] merge the local VS Code plugin work onto the maintained helper and direct
  control surface
- [x] centralize builtin metadata so base install, inspect behavior, and shell
  output suppression share one source of truth
- [x] stream or chunk `WORDS` and `SEE` replies so inspect no longer depends on
  one payload-sized frame
- [x] make malformed control-session requests fail explicitly without widening
  the transport shape
- [x] land `RESET_REQ = 0x07` with reset-to-base-image semantics on the direct
  control path
- [x] add the missing bad-arity `boot` startup regression
- [x] broaden the local helper beyond editor-owned workflows: flashing,
  new-project creation, shared CLI/session reuse, and file send/apply polish
- [x] add one maintained helper-plus-kernel end-to-end smoke on top of the
  landed direct control path, with final hardware confirmation tracked in the
  current-state block
- [x] land the next-stage language-definition docs for records, module slot
  grouping, `cond`/`case`, Frothy-native `try/catch`, restricted
  binding/place designators, and the explicit recovery-boundary story before
  widening runtime semantics again
- [x] align repo-local `froth-cli`, release-time `froth`, and intended global
  `frothy` naming notes before broader discovery and release cleanup
- [x] define the first workspace/image-flow tranche as a doc-only
  slot-bundle-first ADR plus roadmap note before any helper, editor, manifest,
  or kernel surface widens
- [x] reset the post-`v0.1` control surface so `PROGRESS.md`, `TIMELINE.md`,
  `the repo guide`, `README.md`, and one short roadmap note stop carrying separate
  truths about the live queue
