# Frothy Repo Audit 2026-04

Status: landed audit ledger
Date: 2026-04-14
Authority: `docs/spec/Frothy_Language_Spec_v0_1.md`, Frothy ADR-109, Frothy ADR-110, Frothy ADR-111, Frothy ADR-121, `docs/roadmap/Frothy_Development_Roadmap_v0_1.md`

This document is the tracked audit artifact for the current publishability pass.
It does not change code or behavior. It classifies repo-tracked surfaces as
they exist now and turns cleanup into small landable tranches.

Reset status:

- Tranches B through F are now landed on the cleanup branch as tranche-scoped
  commits.
- The maintained sign-off hardware proof is the direct-control ESP32 sanity
  path in `tools/frothy/proof_f1_control_smoke.sh`.
- The remaining follow-up is helper-proof hardening on the heavier M10 and
  VS Code board lanes, not a reopened packaging or runtime-boundary cut.

Decision rules used in this audit:

- optimize for a publishable reset, not for preserving breadth
- treat workshop concerns as sequencing constraints, not as reasons to keep
  under-owned surfaces
- classify each surface as `keep`, `merge`, `quarantine`, `archive`, or
  `delete`
- treat untracked local build noise as out of scope unless it leaks into the
  maintained path through tracked artifacts, docs, or workflows

Classification legend:

- `keep`: the surface belongs in the published Frothy repo as-is in principle
- `merge`: keep the capability, but unify overlapping surfaces into one
- `quarantine`: keep temporarily behind an explicit boundary while it is being
  replaced
- `archive`: keep only as historical or reference material, not in the active
  product path
- `delete`: remove from the maintained tree

## Current Maintained Surface

| Surface | Current truth | Authority source | Required runtimes | Packaged or local-only | Initial classification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Runtime and language core | `src/frothy_*` implements the Frothy language/runtime; many `src/froth_*` units remain required substrate in the same tree; POSIX host build is the default maintained developer path. | `docs/spec/Frothy_Language_Spec_v0_1.md`, `docs/reference/Froth_Substrate_References.md`, `CMakeLists.txt` | `C`, minimal `Shell` | Source of packaged host/runtime artifacts, also local dev | `keep` |
| ESP32 board and platform path | `targets/esp-idf`, `platforms/esp-idf`, `boards/esp32-devkit-v1`, and `boards/esp32-devkit-v4-game-board` are maintained accepted board/platform paths; the narrower workshop promise is the preflashed v4 board, not a protocol-generation split. | Frothy ADR-121, `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `targets/esp-idf/main/CMakeLists.txt` | `C`, `Shell`, ESP-IDF toolchain | Source-based hardware path plus preflashed workshop board | `keep` |
| CLI | `tools/cli` is a real shipped product surface; checkout builds emit `frothy-cli`, release assets ship `frothy`, and the Go module/import path uses Frothy-owned identity internally. Legacy `froth` discovery remains only as explicit compatibility. | `README.md`, `tools/cli/go.mod`, `.github/workflows/release.yml` | `Go`, minimal `Shell` | Packaged and local | `keep` |
| VS Code extension | `tools/vscode` is a real shipped product surface; the packaged extension is helper-based and direct-control-based, not daemon-based. | Frothy ADR-111, `tools/vscode/package.json`, `.github/workflows/release.yml` | `Node` | Packaged and local | `keep` |
| Proof harness | The maintained proof story is now centered on root `make`, the Go test runner, CTest, and thin shell wrappers; hardware lanes also delegate to Go proof commands. | Frothy ADR-109, `Makefile`, `tools/frothy/proof.sh`, `tools/cli/cmd/test-runner/*` | `C`, `Go`, `Shell` | Local and CI | `merge` |
| Release automation | CLI tarballs, VSIX packaging, Homebrew metadata, workshop export checks, and one manual release workflow are active; attendee firmware zips are intentionally not part of the public release surface in this tranche. | Frothy ADR-122, `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `tools/package-release.sh`, `tools/release-common.sh`, `tools/frothy/export_workshop_repo.sh` | `Go`, `Shell`, `Node` | Release-only | `merge` |
| Control docs | The live control surface is thin and correct: repo root README, the roadmap current-state block, Frothy ADRs, `PROGRESS.md`, `TIMELINE.md`, the workshop quickstart, and the extension README all matter, with install steps front-doored through one canonical quickstart. | `README.md`, `docs/guide/Frothy_Workshop_Install_Quickstart.md`, `docs/roadmap/Frothy_Development_Roadmap_v0_1.md`, Frothy ADR-116, `PROGRESS.md`, `TIMELINE.md`, `tools/vscode/README.md` | none | Packaged docs plus local repo docs | `merge` |
| Reference and archive docs | `docs/archive/` and `docs/reference/` are legitimate reference surfaces, not product surfaces. They should stay explicit and non-authoritative. | `docs/spec/README.md`, `docs/adr/README.md`, `docs/reference/Froth_Substrate_References.md` | none | Local-only | `archive` |

## Findings Ledger

### Identity Matrix

| Artifact | Current name | Why it exists now | Keep? | Target end state |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Repo, product, docs, extension branding | `Frothy` | Accepted product identity | yes | keep `Frothy` |
| Repo-local CLI checkout binary | `frothy-cli` | Distinguishes local checkout builds from the installed binary without reusing the old Froth name | yes | keep `frothy-cli` while repo-local and installed paths stay distinct |
| Release/install CLI binary | `frothy` | Frothy-owned installed command name for release packaging and docs | yes | keep `frothy` |
| Go module path | `github.com/nikokozak/frothy/tools/cli` | Frothy-owned module identity aligned with the maintained product repo | yes | keep Frothy-owned module path and keep any future CLI binary rename separate |
| Runtime symbol prefixes | `froth_*` substrate plus `frothy_*` product | Real retained substrate and product code coexist today | yes, with boundary | keep both only if the retained substrate boundary is documented and explicit |

| Area | Item | Current purpose | Authority source | Evidence | Required runtimes | Packaged or local-only | Classification | Recommended action | Migration blocker | Proof command after cleanup |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Editor/control | `tools/vscode/src/daemon-client.ts`, `tools/vscode/src/daemon-supervisor.ts`, `tools/vscode/src/froth-paths.ts` | Historical daemon/socket editor path | Frothy ADR-111, `tools/vscode/package.json`, `tools/vscode/test/package-smoke.js` | Active extension code imports `control-session-client`; packaged files omit daemon outputs; package smoke explicitly forbids `out/daemon-client.js`, `out/daemon-supervisor.js`, and `out/froth-paths.js` | `Node` | Local-only source | `delete` | Remove daemon-era TS source and any stale references; keep the helper-owned control-session path only | none; the packaged path already excludes these files | `cd tools/vscode && npm test && npm run test:package` |
| Identity | `tools/cli/go.mod` and Go imports now use `github.com/nikokozak/frothy/...` | Buildable CLI module path with Frothy-owned identity | Frothy ADR-109, `tools/cli/go.mod`, `tools/cli/main.go` | Module declaration and imports now match the product repo identity while the installed binary name is also Frothy-owned | `Go` | Packaged and local | `keep` | Keep the Frothy-owned module and installed binary identity aligned | none | `cd tools/cli && go test ./... && go list ./...` |
| Identity | Legacy `froth` compatibility is now isolated to explicit transition points | Keep side-by-side installs workable while not teaching two equal command names | `README.md`, `tools/vscode/README.md`, `tools/vscode/src/cli-discovery.ts`, `tools/cli/cmd/root.go`, Frothy ADR-120 | Active docs and discovery now prefer `frothy`; only sanctioned compatibility points still mention legacy `froth` | `Go`, `Node` | Packaged and local | `keep` | Keep compatibility narrow and temporary; do not reintroduce equal dual-command packaging | stale local docs or scripts could still mention `froth` until separately cleaned | `make test-all && rg -n 'frothy-cli|legacy `froth`|Installed command: frothy' README.md tools/vscode/README.md tools/vscode/src/cli-discovery.ts tools/cli/cmd/root.go` |
| Proofs | Proof orchestration is split across `make`, Go, and shell | Run host tests, CLI tests, extension-local proofs, and hardware smokes | Frothy ADR-109, `Makefile`, `tools/frothy/proof.sh`, `tools/cli/cmd/test-runner/proofs.go` | Root `make` builds a Go test runner; `make test` and `make test-all` stay on the core `C`/`Go`/`Shell` lanes, while `make test-publishability` adds the shipped VS Code host smoke without pretending the real-device editor lane is automatic | `C`, `Go`, `Shell`, extension-local `Node` | Local and CI | `merge` | Keep one proof matrix, one explicit full-surface local gate, and thin shell wrappers only where they add no policy | ESP32 device lanes still need distinct device handling | `make test && make test-all && make test-publishability && make test-list` |
| Repo pollution | Former tracked binary `tools/cli/test-runner` | Historical compiled local executable; the maintained runner now lives under build output only | Frothy ADR-109, `Makefile`, `tools/cli/Makefile` | `tools/cli/test-runner` is no longer tracked, and root `make` builds the maintained runner to `build/test/bin/froth-test-runner` | none | Local-only generated artifact | `delete` | Keep it untracked and rely on generated build output only | none | `! git ls-files | rg '^tools/cli/test-runner$' && make test` |
| Dependency budget | `tools/firmware_manifest_files.go` plus `tools/package-firmware-release.sh` | Parse `flasher_args.json` and package firmware zips without Python | `tools/package-firmware-release.sh`, `tools/firmware_manifest_files.go`, `.github/workflows/release.yml` | Release packaging now uses a small Go helper rather than inline `python3` to enumerate manifest files | `Go`, `Shell` | Release-only | `keep` | Keep release packaging on the smaller `Go` + `Shell` dependency budget | none | `! rg -n 'python3' tools/package-firmware-release.sh && ./tools/package-firmware-release.sh targets/esp-idf/build $(cat VERSION) /tmp/frothy-firmware-test.zip` |
| Dependency budget | Former Python-backed hardware smokes | Exercise ESP32 proof paths | `tools/frothy/proof_m10_smoke.sh`, `tools/frothy/proof_v4_workshop_surface.sh`, `tools/cli/cmd/test-runner/` | The old Python serial proof scripts were removed in the May pre-thesis prune; maintained hardware wrappers now delegate to Go test-runner commands | `Go`, `Shell` | Hardware-only | `keep` | Keep hardware proof orchestration on the Go direct-control surface with shell wrappers only | real-device proof still requires an attached board | `make test && make test-all` for local lanes; `sh tools/frothy/proof.sh m10 <PORT>` and `sh tools/frothy/proof.sh workshop-v4 <PORT>` for hardware lanes |
| Runtime boundary | `src/froth_*` retained substrate and `src/frothy_*` product code are interleaved | Build the actual runtime today | `docs/reference/Froth_Substrate_References.md`, `CMakeLists.txt` | Host and ESP32 targets compile a large mixed list of `froth_*` and `frothy_*` units from the same directory without an explicit structural boundary | `C` | Packaged and local | `merge` | Produce an explicit retained-substrate manifest, then separate or namespace substrate code without blindly renaming working units | Frothy runtime and tests directly link many substrate units | `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build && ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -L frothy` |
| Runtime boundary | Compatibility layer files `src/compat/frothy_console_compat.c` and `src/compat/frothy_link_stub.c` | Bridge inherited interfaces during the transition behind an explicit compatibility boundary | Frothy ADR-109, Frothy ADR-110, `src/compat/frothy_console_compat.c`, `src/compat/frothy_link_stub.c` | `frothy_console_compat.c` exists only to answer an inherited idle query; `frothy_link_stub.c` returns `FROTH_ERROR_LINK_UNKNOWN_TYPE` for inherited link callbacks | `C` | Packaged and local | `quarantine` | Keep the compatibility layer explicit and delete it once no retained interface still needs it | host and ESP32 targets still compile it | `rg -n 'compat|stub' src/compat/frothy_console_compat.c src/compat/frothy_link_stub.c CMakeLists.txt targets/esp-idf/main/CMakeLists.txt && make test` |
| Hygiene | Misleading `TODO` banners on maintained ESP32 files | None; these comments now understate real code | Frothy ADR-121, `boards/esp32-devkit-v1/ffi.c`, `platforms/esp-idf/platform.c`, `targets/esp-idf/main/main.c` | `ffi.c` and `platform.c` contain real active implementations but still open with `TODO`; `main.c` is a live wrapper but also marked `TODO` | `C` | Source and local | `merge` | Remove false placeholder labeling from kept files so TODO means genuinely incomplete work again | none | `! rg -n '^/\\* TODO:' boards/esp32-devkit-v1/ffi.c platforms/esp-idf/platform.c targets/esp-idf/main/main.c && make test-all` |
| Docs | README front door, workshop quickstart, extension README, and roadmap notes | Explain install, extension behavior, and the workshop path without duplicating commands across product docs | `README.md`, `docs/guide/Frothy_Workshop_Install_Quickstart.md`, `tools/vscode/README.md`, `docs/roadmap/Frothy_Post_v0_1_Priorities_And_Workshop_Prep.md` | The canonical install commands now live in the quickstart; README and extension README describe only the maintained boundary and extension-specific expectations | none | Packaged docs and local docs | `keep` | Keep the quickstart as the canonical install note and keep roadmap notes queue-shaped rather than user-install-shaped | support matrix still needs to stay truthful as it evolves | `rg -n 'brew install frothy|code --install-extension|frothy doctor' README.md tools/vscode/README.md docs/guide/Frothy_Workshop_Install_Quickstart.md` |
| Dependency budget | Node toolchain is legitimate only because the VS Code extension is a kept shipped surface | Build, test, and package the extension | Frothy ADR-111, `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `tools/vscode/package.json` | Release workflow has a dedicated `build-vscode` job; root `make test` does not require Node | `Node` | Release-only and extension-local | `keep` | Codify Node as extension-only and release-only; do not add it to the root Frothy proof contract | none | `make test && make test-all && (cd tools/vscode && npm test && npm run test:package)` |

## Cut Ledger

| Area | Item | Current purpose | Authority source | Evidence | Required runtimes | Packaged or local-only | Classification | Recommended action | Migration blocker | Proof command after cleanup |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Editor/control | `tools/vscode/src/daemon-client.ts` | Historical daemon JSON-RPC client | Frothy ADR-111, `tools/vscode/test/package-smoke.js` | Forbidden from the packaged VSIX and unused by the active helper-based extension | `Node` | Local-only | `delete` | Delete the file and keep helper-owned control session only | none | `cd tools/vscode && npm test && npm run test:package` |
| Editor/control | `tools/vscode/src/daemon-supervisor.ts` | Historical daemon lifecycle manager | Frothy ADR-111, `tools/vscode/test/package-smoke.js` | Forbidden from the packaged VSIX and contradicts the no-daemon editor path | `Node` | Local-only | `delete` | Delete the file and remove any remaining daemon ownership assumptions | none | `cd tools/vscode && npm test && npm run test:package` |
| Editor/control | `tools/vscode/src/froth-paths.ts` | Historical daemon socket path helper | Frothy ADR-111, `tools/vscode/test/package-smoke.js` | Its only purpose is the daemon socket path; package smoke forbids its output | `Node` | Local-only | `delete` | Delete the file with the daemon client/supervisor tranche | none | `cd tools/vscode && npm test && npm run test:package` |
| Repo pollution | `tools/cli/test-runner` | None; compiled artifact committed into the tree | Frothy ADR-109, `Makefile` | Tracked Mach-O executable; maintained build emits runner under `build/test/bin` instead | none | Local-only | `delete` | Remove from Git and keep it in `.gitignore` by policy through generated build paths only | none | `! git ls-files | rg '^tools/cli/test-runner$' && make test` |

## Consolidation Ledger

| Area | Item | Current purpose | Authority source | Evidence | Required runtimes | Packaged or local-only | Classification | Recommended action | Migration blocker | Proof command after cleanup |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Identity | Published identity matrix for repo, CLI binary, module path, and docs wording | Keep the fork transition workable | Frothy ADR-109, `README.md`, `tools/cli/go.mod`, `tools/vscode/src/cli-discovery.ts` | Identity is currently explicit but spread across too many surfaces | `Go`, `Node` | Packaged and local | `merge` | Freeze one matrix, then land module-path cleanup and naming cleanup as separate reviewable cuts | binary rename and module rename should not land in the same patch | `make test-publishability && cd tools/cli && go test ./...` |
| Proofs | Root proof entrypoints, Go runner, shell wrappers, and hardware lanes | Run local, CI, and hardware verification | Frothy ADR-109, `Makefile`, `tools/frothy/proof.sh`, `tools/cli/cmd/test-runner/*` | There are too many entrypoints for what is conceptually one proof system | `C`, `Go`, `Shell` | Local and CI | `merge` | Keep one proof matrix and one main dispatcher, with `make test-publishability` as the explicit full local shipped-surface gate; demote shell to thin wrappers and keep hardware-only handling inside the Go runner | hardware lanes still need distinct device handling | `make test && make test-all && make test-publishability && make test-list` |
| Packaging | CLI tarball packaging, workshop export verification, VSIX packaging, and release notes | Ship the released public artifacts only | Frothy ADR-122, `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `tools/package-release.sh`, `tools/vscode/package.json`, `tools/frothy/export_workshop_repo.sh` | Packaging is functionally complete and now uses a smaller runtime budget: `Go` + `Shell` for CLI and workshop export, and `Node` only for the extension | `Go`, `Shell`, `Node` | Release-only | `merge` | Keep the release surface small and keep Node scoped to the extension only | none on the public release-packaging side | `.github/workflows/release.yml` succeeds on the CLI, workshop-surface, and VSIX jobs |
| Runtime boundary | Retained Froth substrate versus Frothy product code | Keep working substrate while tightening repo shape | `docs/reference/Froth_Substrate_References.md`, `CMakeLists.txt` | Boundary is real in docs but not explicit in directory layout or naming policy | `C` | Packaged and local | `merge` | Write down the retained substrate set, quarantine compatibility shims, then move or namespace only what remains justified | large CMake/test link surface still mixes both layers | `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build && ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -L frothy` |
| Docs | Root README, workshop quickstart, extension README, roadmap notes, and queue docs | Explain install, release, and the active control surface | Frothy ADR-116, `README.md`, `docs/guide/Frothy_Workshop_Install_Quickstart.md`, `tools/vscode/README.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, `TIMELINE.md` | Guidance is now split cleanly between one front door, one canonical install note, one extension-specific doc, and the live queue docs | none | Packaged docs and local docs | `merge` | Keep one front door, one canonical install note, one extension-specific doc, one live queue, and archive historical prose that still matters | frozen support matrix still needs to stay truthful as it evolves | `rg -n 'brew install frothy|code --install-extension|frothy doctor' README.md tools/vscode/README.md docs/guide/Frothy_Workshop_Install_Quickstart.md` |
| Dependency budget | Node exception | Support the extension while keeping core and hardware proof paths on C/Go/shell | Frothy ADR-111, `tools/vscode/package.json`, `tools/frothy/proof_m10_smoke.sh`, `tools/package-firmware-release.sh` | Node is justified by the kept VSIX surface and now sits behind `make test-vscode` / `make test-publishability`; Python proof and release glue has been replaced | extension-local `Node` | Release-only and extension-local | `quarantine` | Keep Node explicit and prevent it from entering the core root proof path | none for Python; VS Code remains the remaining non-core runtime | `make test && make test-all` with no Node or Python required, plus `make test-publishability` when the shipped extension surface changes |
| Board support | Sanctioned board/platform surface | Keep the repo small and truthful | Frothy ADR-121, `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `boards/README.md` | The attendee/workshop promise is intentionally narrower than the repo surface: v4 is the mounted preflashed workshop board, while v1 remains an accepted source-based board model | `C`, `Shell` | Published CLI/editor surface plus local hardware paths | `merge` | Publish an explicit support matrix and trim or quarantine anything that suggests broader active support than the repo actually proves | clean-machine and room-pack execution still remain | `rg -n 'esp32-devkit-v1|esp32-devkit-v4-game-board|frothy\\.frothy|pong\\.frothy' README.md tools/vscode/README.md .github/workflows/release.yml boards/README.md docs/guide/Frothy_Workshop_Install_Quickstart.md` |

## Implementation Tranches

### Tranche A: Audit Scaffold

Purpose:

- land this audit artifact and freeze the cleanup vocabulary before changing
  code

Scope:

- no runtime or tooling behavior changes
- no doc edits outside this file
- classify every top-level maintained surface once

Exit criteria:

- this audit exists in-tree
- all six required sections are present
- every finding row carries a classification and a proof target

Proof:

- `rg -n '^## Current Maintained Surface|^## Findings Ledger|^## Cut Ledger|^## Consolidation Ledger|^## Implementation Tranches|^## Proof Impact' docs/audit/Frothy_Repo_Audit_2026-04.md`

### Tranche B: Immediate Cuts

Purpose:

- remove dead packaged-surface drift and tracked repo pollution first

In scope:

- delete the daemon-era VS Code files
- untrack `tools/cli/test-runner`
- archive proof transcript artifacts out of `tools/frothy/`

Held boundary:

- no binary rename
- no module-path rename
- no proof runner rewrite yet

Exit criteria:

- no daemon-era files remain in the active extension tree
- no compiled binaries are tracked in `tools/cli/`
- historical transcripts live under docs, not active tooling

Proof:

- `make test`
- `cd tools/vscode && npm test && npm run test:package`

### Tranche C: Identity and Packaging Normalization

Purpose:

- freeze one publishable naming story and remove avoidable identity leaks

In scope:

- publish the identity matrix in README/release/install docs
- normalize Go module path and imports
- reduce stray `froth`/`froth-cli` wording outside sanctioned transition points

Held boundary:

- do not rename the installed CLI binary in the same tranche as the module path
- do not touch runtime symbol prefixes yet

Exit criteria:

- one documented identity matrix exists
- the Go module path no longer advertises the old repo identity
- only sanctioned transition points mention old binary names

Proof:

- `cd tools/cli && go test ./...`
- `make test-all`
- `make test-publishability`

### Tranche D: Proof and Dependency Collapse

Purpose:

- reduce the proof story to one four-tier matrix and push non-core runtimes out
  of the default path

In scope:

- collapse proof dispatch around the Go runner
- remove Python from release packaging
- keep hardware-only exceptions explicit
- codify Node as extension-only and release-only

Held boundary:

- hardware smoke may stay temporarily separate if the replacement is not ready
- do not widen the root `make` surface to require Node or Python

Exit criteria:

- `make test` and `make test-all` need only `C`, `Go`, and thin `Shell`
- `make test-publishability` adds the shipped VS Code host lane without implying hardware coverage
- firmware packaging no longer shells out to Python
- the proof matrix is documented and discoverable through one command

Proof:

- `make test`
- `make test-all`
- `make test-publishability`
- `make test-list`

### Tranche E: Runtime Boundary Tightening

Purpose:

- make the retained Froth substrate explicit and quarantine compatibility glue

In scope:

- write down the retained substrate set in code-adjacent docs or build metadata
- isolate compatibility shims and stubs
- remove false `TODO`/placeholder signaling from active maintained files

Held boundary:

- no speculative rewrite of working substrate
- no blind global renaming of `froth_*` symbols

Exit criteria:

- every retained `froth_*` unit has a clear justification
- compatibility shims are explicit and bounded
- active maintained files no longer present themselves as placeholders

Proof:

- `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build`
- `ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -L frothy`

### Tranche F: Docs Front Door and Archive Pass

Purpose:

- make the repo read like one small product again

In scope:

- keep one root front door
- shorten extension docs to extension-specific behavior
- keep roadmap, `PROGRESS.md`, and `TIMELINE.md` queue-shaped only
- move historical proof artifacts and stale prose into archive/reference space

Held boundary:

- do not turn the roadmap or timeline back into narrative status logs
- do not duplicate install instructions across product docs

Exit criteria:

- install and release instructions have one canonical home
- extension README no longer repeats repo-front-door material
- historical proof evidence is archived, not mixed into active tooling

Proof:

- `rg -n 'brew install frothy|code --install-extension|frothy doctor' README.md tools/vscode/README.md`
- `sh tools/frothy/proof_control_surface_docs.sh`

## Proof Impact

### Target Proof Tiers

| Tier | Purpose | Target commands | Required runtimes | Policy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Core local gate | Fast default proof for normal Frothy work | `make test` | `C`, `Go`, minimal `Shell` | Must not require `Node` or `Python` |
| Extended local gate | Full host and CLI regression pass | `make test-all` | `C`, `Go`, minimal `Shell` | Must not require `Node` or `Python` |
| Full shipped-surface gate | Extended local gate plus VS Code host smoke and package smoke | `make test-publishability` | `C`, `Go`, `Shell`, extension-local `Node` | Must stay local-only; real-device editor proof remains a separate explicit lane |
| Hardware-only gate | Device-specific proof for sanctioned board paths | `sh tools/frothy/proof.sh m10 <PORT>` or its later replacement | `C`, `Go`, `Shell` | Explicit real-device lane; not part of default local publishability gate |
| Release-only gate | Build shipped artifacts and packaging proofs | `.github/workflows/release.yml` lanes or local equivalents | `Go`, `Shell`, `Node` | `Node` is justified only here and in extension-local development |

### Dependency Budget

- Core repo budget: `C`, `Go`, minimal `Shell`
- `Node` is allowed only because the VS Code extension is a kept shipped
  surface
- `Python` is not acceptable in the maintained Frothy build, test, release, or
  proof paths
- No tracked compiled binaries or generated SDK artifacts belong in the repo

### Completion Bar For This Audit

This audit is complete when all of the following are true:

- every top-level maintained surface in the repo is classified
- every removal candidate has explicit evidence
- every kept surface has one proof command after cleanup
- every non-core dependency is justified or marked for migration out
- the cleanup backlog is ordered into independent tranches with no hidden
  policy decisions left for implementation
