# Frothy

Frothy is a small live lexical language for programmable devices.

Frothy `v0.1` is functionally closed.

The live roadmap milestone is `evaluator execution-stack hardening`. The
workshop-facing release/install surface stays intentionally narrow and
truthful while that runtime tranche lands.

The forward queue after that is explicit:

- FFI boundary quality and porting discipline
- small useful core library growth
- robust string support
- measured performance tightening
- direct-control tooling improvements
- later workspace/image-flow growth only after the workshop-critical tranches
  prove themselves

See `docs/roadmap/Frothy_Post_v0_1_Priorities_And_Workshop_Prep.md` for the
kept-vs-deferred stack.

The repo reuses inherited Froth substrate where that is the simplest working
path, but Froth's old roadmap, stack-centric user model, and language
priorities are not active policy here.

## Start Here

Use the smallest maintained doc set for the workshop path:

- `docs/guide/Frothy_Workshop_Install_Quickstart.md`: attendee install note
  and preflight
- `docs/guide/Frothy_Workshop_Quick_Reference.md`: first connect, inspection,
  board surface, persistence, and troubleshooting
- `docs/guide/Frothy_Workshop_Clean_Machine_Validation.md`: promised-platform
  validation checklist and recording sheet
- `boards/esp32-devkit-v1/WORKSHOP.md`: room-side hardware pack-out and
  recovery card
- `docs/roadmap/Frothy_Workshop_Rehearsal_Closeout_2026-04-14.md`: workshop
  rehearsal status note and required real-device proof command

## Workshop Support Matrix

The promised attendee path is smaller than the repo surface:

| Surface | Published now | Workshop promise |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CLI release | `frothy-v<version>-darwin-arm64.tar.gz`, `frothy-v<version>-darwin-amd64.tar.gz`, `frothy-v<version>-linux-amd64.tar.gz` | macOS via Homebrew is the preferred attendee path; Linux x86_64 can use the release tarball directly |
| VS Code | `frothy-vscode-v<extension-version>.vsix` | supported on the same machines that can already run the installed CLI |
| Firmware / recovery | `frothy-v<version>-esp32-devkit-v1.zip` | preflashed `esp32-devkit-v1` only |
| Source build | checkout build via `make build` | maintainer path, not required before the workshop |

Windows, extra boards, and custom toolchain setups are not part of the
maintained attendee promise for this tranche.

## Naming Matrix

The published naming split is explicit for now:

| Thing | Name today |
| --- | --- |
| Product, repo, docs, release assets, Homebrew formula, and editor surface | `Frothy` / `frothy` |
| Installed CLI command from released assets | `froth` |
| Repo-local checkout CLI build | `tools/cli/froth-cli` |
| Host runtime built from source | `build/Frothy` |

That transitional split is deliberate. Frothy owns the public product and
release identity; the shipped command name stays `froth` until a later CLI
rename slice is worth the churn.

## Workshop Install

The attendee quickstart lives in
`docs/guide/Frothy_Workshop_Install_Quickstart.md`.
The in-room prompt and recovery cheat sheet lives in
`docs/guide/Frothy_Workshop_Quick_Reference.md`.

Install the maintained Frothy CLI path first.

Preferred macOS workshop path:

```sh
brew tap nikokozak/frothy
brew install frothy
froth doctor
```

Linux x86_64 release-tarball path:

```sh
tar -xzf frothy-v<version>-linux-amd64.tar.gz
mkdir -p "$HOME/.local/bin"
install -m 0755 froth "$HOME/.local/bin/froth"
froth doctor
```

Then install the matching VS Code extension asset from the GitHub Release:

```sh
code --install-extension /path/to/frothy-vscode-v<extension-version>.vsix
```

If VS Code cannot find `froth` on `PATH`, set `frothy.cliPath` to the absolute
path of the installed binary.

Attendees do not need a repo checkout, `esp-idf`, or source builds before they
arrive. The maintained path assumes a preflashed `esp32-devkit-v1`.

The maintained editor path stays on the accepted direct-control surface:

- VS Code owns one helper child per window
- the helper owns one direct control session at a time
- there is no daemon, shared port owner, or local editor runtime in the
  maintained workshop path

`Send Selection / Line` is intentional additive eval.
`Send File` is whole-file `reset + eval`; if the connected firmware is too old
for control `reset`, the extension blocks the send and asks you to upgrade or
reflash instead of replaying the file unsafely.

## Build And Test

From a checkout:

```sh
make build
make run
make test
make test-all
```

The host build produces:

- `build/Frothy`: primary Frothy host runtime

The maintained test contract is:

- `make test`: fast self-contained local gate
- `make test-all`: exhaustive local gate
- `make test-list`: list maintained suites and profiles
- `sh tools/frothy/proof_workshop_ops_docs.sh`: workshop front-door and ops
  docs sanity
- `sh tools/frothy/proof_m10_smoke.sh --assume-blink-confirmed --transcript-out /tmp/frothy-m10.txt <PORT>`:
  real-device workshop proof

Run the currently shipped CLI as `froth`:

```sh
froth --version
froth doctor
froth build
froth flash
froth connect
froth send src/main.froth
```

## Active Docs

- `docs/spec/Frothy_Language_Spec_v0_1.md`: normative Frothy language and
  interactive-profile spec
- `docs/spec/Frothy_Language_Spec_vNext.md` and
  `docs/spec/Frothy_Surface_Syntax_Proposal_vNext.md`: draft next-stage
  language direction without widening current behavior
- `docs/roadmap/Frothy_Development_Roadmap_v0_1.md`: live control surface and
  accepted milestone roadmap
- `docs/roadmap/Frothy_Post_v0_1_Priorities_And_Workshop_Prep.md`: near-term
  post-`v0.1` queue and workshop gate
- `docs/adr/README.md`: ADR authority split and Frothy `100`-series index
- `PROGRESS.md`: thin operational note
- `TIMELINE.md`: movable checkbox ledger

## Reference Material

The original Froth repo at `/Users/niko/Developer/Froth` is reference material
only. Use it for substrate reuse, boot/persistence/transport background, and
implementation salvage where explicitly adopted. Do not treat its roadmap,
language semantics, repo-local startup guidance, or implementation priorities as active
Frothy policy.

See `docs/reference/Froth_Substrate_References.md` for the curated reference
set that remains useful during the transition.

Historical Froth-era design notes now live under `docs/archive/`.

## Repo Shape

- The repo root is the source of truth for kernel, platform, board, and target
  sources.
- `make sdk-payload` generates the CLI's embedded SDK archive from that source
  tree; the repo does not track a maintained mirror under
  `tools/cli/internal/sdk`.
- Stale bootstrap drafts, legacy runtime code, and archived Froth design notes
  are not part of the live control surface.
