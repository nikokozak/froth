# Frothy

Frothy is a small live lexical language for programmable devices.

Frothy `v0.1` is functionally closed. The active work is `F1 Core hardening`:
syntax rollout, measured runtime cleanup, and a smaller control transport
without changing the accepted semantics, snapshot contract, or FFI boundary.

The repo reuses inherited Froth substrate where that is the simplest working
path, but Froth's old roadmap, stack-centric user model, and language
priorities are not active policy here.

## Build And Test

From a checkout:

```sh
make build
make run
make test
make test-all
```

The host build produces:

- `build/Frothy`: primary Frothy host runtime

The maintained test contract is:

- `make test`: fast self-contained local gate
- `make test-all`: exhaustive local gate
- `make test-list`: list maintained suites and profiles

The CLI surface remains Frothy-first:

```sh
froth --version
froth doctor
froth build
froth flash
froth connect
froth send src/main.froth
```

Those names stay in place for now. Frothy repo policy and release identity are
separated from inherited Froth, but the external CLI and implementation-symbol
transition is deliberately narrower than the language/runtime cleanup.

## Active Docs

- `docs/spec/Frothy_Language_Spec_v0_1.md`: normative Frothy language and
  interactive-profile spec
- `docs/roadmap/Frothy_Development_Roadmap_v0_1.md`: live control surface and
  milestone tracker
- `docs/adr/README.md`: ADR authority split and Frothy `100`-series index
- `PROGRESS.md`: thin execution journal
- `TIMELINE.md`: thin milestone ledger

## Reference Material

The original Froth repo at `/Users/niko/Developer/Froth` is reference material
only. Use it for substrate reuse, boot/persistence/transport background, and
implementation salvage where explicitly adopted. Do not treat its roadmap,
language semantics, repo-local startup guidance, or implementation priorities as active
Frothy policy.

See `docs/reference/Froth_Substrate_References.md` for the curated reference
set that remains useful during the transition.

Historical Froth-era design notes now live under `docs/archive/`.

## Repo Shape

- The repo root is the source of truth for kernel, platform, board, and target
  sources.
- `make sdk-payload` generates the CLI's embedded SDK archive from that source
  tree; the repo does not track a maintained mirror under
  `tools/cli/internal/sdk`.
- Stale bootstrap drafts, legacy runtime code, and archived Froth design notes
  are not part of the live control surface.
