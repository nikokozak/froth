# Frothy

Frothy is a small live lexical language for programmable devices.

Frothy `v0.1` is functionally closed.

The active repo work is post-`v0.1` control-surface repair and workshop
readiness for 2026-04-16, with the next implementation cut kept deliberately
small: first workshop install/editor/recovery hardening across CLI release,
VS Code distribution, and reset-safe whole-file send.

The forward queue after that is explicit:

- FFI boundary quality and porting discipline
- small useful core library growth
- robust string support
- measured performance tightening
- direct-control tooling improvements
- later workspace/image-flow growth only after the workshop-critical tranches
  prove themselves

See `docs/roadmap/Frothy_Post_v0_1_Priorities_And_Workshop_Prep.md` for the
kept-vs-deferred stack.

The repo reuses inherited Froth substrate where that is the simplest working
path, but Froth's old roadmap, stack-centric user model, and language
priorities are not active policy here.

## Build And Test

From a checkout:

```sh
make build
make run
make test
make test-all
```

The host build produces:

- `build/Frothy`: primary Frothy host runtime

The maintained test contract is:

- `make test`: fast self-contained local gate
- `make test-all`: exhaustive local gate
- `make test-list`: list maintained suites and profiles

The current CLI naming split is explicit:

- repo-local `froth-cli`: checkout builds produce `tools/cli/froth-cli`
- release-time `froth`: packaged and installed CLI command name today
- intended global `frothy`: product, repo, and editor identity that later
  cleanup may converge toward

Run the currently shipped CLI as `froth`:

```sh
froth --version
froth doctor
froth build
froth flash
froth connect
froth send src/main.froth
```

That command surface stays transitional for now. Frothy repo policy and release
identity are separated from inherited Froth, but the command and
implementation-symbol transition is deliberately narrower than the
language/runtime cleanup.

## Workshop Install

Install the maintained Frothy CLI path first:

```sh
brew tap nikokozak/frothy
brew install frothy
froth doctor
```

Then install the matching VS Code extension asset from the GitHub Release:

```sh
code --install-extension /path/to/frothy-vscode-v<extension-version>.vsix
```

The maintained editor path stays on the accepted direct-control surface:

- VS Code owns one helper child per window
- the helper owns one direct control session at a time
- there is no daemon, shared port owner, or local editor runtime in the
  maintained workshop path

`Send Selection / Line` is intentional additive eval.
`Send File` is whole-file `reset + eval`; if the connected firmware is too old
for control `reset`, the extension blocks the send and asks you to upgrade or
reflash instead of replaying the file unsafely.

## Reference Material

The original Froth repo at `/Users/niko/Developer/Froth` is reference material
only. Use it for substrate reuse, boot/persistence/transport background, and
implementation salvage where explicitly adopted. Do not treat its roadmap,
language semantics, repo-local startup guidance, or implementation priorities as active
Frothy policy.

See `docs/reference/Froth_Substrate_References.md` for the curated reference
set that remains useful during the transition.

Historical Froth-era design notes now live under `docs/archive/`.

## Repo Shape

- The repo root is the source of truth for kernel, platform, board, and target
  sources.
- `make sdk-payload` generates the CLI's embedded SDK archive from that source
  tree; the repo does not track a maintained mirror under
  `tools/cli/internal/sdk`.
- Stale bootstrap drafts, legacy runtime code, and archived Froth design notes
  are not part of the live control surface.
