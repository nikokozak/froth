# Frothy Timeline

*Last updated: 2026-05-03*

This file is the movable milestone and queue ledger for Frothy.
The roadmap current-state block in
`docs/roadmap/Frothy_Development_Roadmap_v0_1.md` remains the live control
surface.

If this file and the roadmap disagree, the roadmap wins.

  `docs/archive/proofs/m10_esp32_proof_transcript.txt`.

## Movable Post-v0.1 Queue

The queue below is intentionally movable. Reorder it as priorities change, but
keep each item's description and references so deferral does not erase context.

- [~] Pre-thesis publishability prune and dependency collapse
  Deliverable: remove low-risk legacy Froth residue, replace remaining Python
  proof helpers with Go or delete them from the maintained surface, keep
  generated PDFs out of active source unless rebuilt outside the core dependency
  budget, keep VS Code/Node explicitly extension-local if retained, and decide
  the `froth.toml` / `.froth-build` / `.froth` project-format rename through a
  new Frothy ADR before implementation.
  Current cut: default local testing is now proportional again. `make test`
  runs fast host CTest plus CLI unit tests, while slow CTest and host smoke
  proofs remain in `make test-all` and `make test-frothy`; the CLI SDK payload
  generator now excludes ignored ESP-IDF build caches.

  `AGENTS.md`, Frothy ADR-120, `tools/frothy/`,
  `tools/cli/cmd/test-runner/`, and `docs/audit/Frothy_Repo_Audit_2026-04.md`.
- [x] Prompt-facing record surface matches the landed implementation
  Deliverable: the prompt-facing shell accepts the maintained `record ...`
  forms and keeps record definition, construction, field access, inspection,
  and save/restore behavior aligned with the landed parser, evaluator, and
  snapshot record surface.

  `tests/frothy_shell_test.c`, `tests/frothy_parser_test.c`,
  `tests/frothy_snapshot_test.c`, and
  `docs/spec/Frothy_Language_Spec_vNext.md`.
- [x] Control-surface repair and workshop-prep note
  Deliverable: thin `PROGRESS.md`, movable `TIMELINE.md`, task-scoped startup
  guidance, and one forward-priority note.
  References: Frothy ADR-116 and
  `docs/roadmap/Frothy_Post_v0_1_Priorities_And_Workshop_Prep.md`.
- [x] Workshop install, editor, and recovery surface
  Deliverable: make install, device discovery, connect, interrupt, reconnect,
  and reset-safe send dependable on the maintained Frothy path.
  References: Frothy ADR-110, Frothy ADR-111, Frothy ADR-113,
  `tools/package-release.sh`, and `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
- [x] Inspection-first teaching surface
  Deliverable: make `words`, `see`, `core`, `slotInfo`, and `@` clean enough
  for the workshop exploration and puzzle path.
  References: `docs/spec/Frothy_Language_Spec_v0_1.md`,
  Frothy ADR-107, `docs/spec/Frothy_Language_Spec_vNext.md`, and
  Frothy ADR-114.
- [x] Workshop base-image library and board surface
  Deliverable: define the preflashed workshop base library and the board
  surface for blink, animation, `millis`, ADC, GPIO, and related helpers.
  References: Frothy ADR-108,
  `docs/roadmap/Frothy_M9_Board_FFI_Closeout.md`, and
  `docs/spec/Frothy_Language_Spec_v0_1.md`, Appendix C.
- [x] Embedded tool surface tranche 1
  Deliverable: stop treating `v0.1` as the whole user-facing ceiling, and ship
  a first serious embedded-helper cut through the maintained base image:
  `map`, `clamp`, `mod`, `wrap`, and integer `random.*` helpers plus short
  aliases.

  `boards/esp32-devkit-v4-game-board/lib/base.frothy`, and
  `tests/frothy_ffi_test.c`.
- [x] Readability language tranche: `in prefix`, `cond`, `case`, and ordinary-code `@`
  Deliverable: land the narrow language additions that most improve workshop
  code and small-library readability without reopening the slot/image model.
  References: Frothy ADR-112, `docs/spec/Frothy_Language_Spec_vNext.md`,
  `docs/spec/Frothy_Surface_Syntax_Proposal_vNext.md`, and Frothy ADR-114.
- [x] Records for workshop/game objects
  Deliverable: add fixed-layout records for workshop and game-object use
  without widening Frothy into dynamic object bags.
  References: Frothy ADR-112, `docs/spec/Frothy_Language_Spec_vNext.md`, and
  Frothy ADR-114.
- [x] Workshop-tranche safety closeout
  Deliverable: fix tranche-local regressions, rerun the proof ladder, and stop
  only after repeated review passes stop surfacing major findings.
  References: `make test`, `make test-cli-local`, `make test-integration`, and
  `make test-all`.
- [x] Support matrix and release/install artifacts
  Deliverable: freeze the promised attendee matrix in-repo and keep the CLI
  plus VSIX install path truthful.
  References: `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `tools/package-release.sh`,
  `tools/vscode/README.md`, `README.md`, and
  `docs/guide/Frothy_Workshop_Install_Quickstart.md`.
- [x] Attendee-facing naming alignment
  Deliverable: ship the Frothy-owned `frothy` installed command and
  `frothy-cli` repo-local build, while keeping legacy `froth` fallback only at
  explicit transition points so attendees do not bounce between equal names.
  References: `README.md`, `tools/vscode/README.md`,
  `tools/package-release.sh`, and `tools/cli/Makefile`.
- [x] Attendee install email and quickstart
  Deliverable: one sendable install note that explains the CLI/extension split,
  supported platforms, serial expectations, and the first-run path.
  References: `README.md`,
  `docs/guide/Frothy_Workshop_Install_Quickstart.md`,
  `tools/vscode/README.md`, and `docs/guide/Frothy_From_The_Ground_Up.md`.
- [x] Workshop preflight and serial recovery path
  Deliverable: a clean preflight path for CLI presence, extension
  compatibility, serial visibility, board handshake, and fallback recovery on
  the maintained Frothy path.
  References: `tools/cli/cmd/doctor.go`,
  `tools/cli/internal/serial/discover.go`,
  `tools/vscode/src/control-session-client.ts`,
  `tools/frothy/proof_f1_control_smoke.sh`, and
  `tools/frothy/proof_m10_smoke.sh`.
- [x] Workshop starter project and frozen board/game surface
  Deliverable: one sanctioned editable workshop starter surface, exported as
  the public workshop repo source and proved through the maintained host and
  board ladders.
  References: `tools/cli/cmd/new.go`,
  `tools/cli/internal/project/starter.go`,
  `tools/frothy/export_workshop_repo.sh`,
  `workshop/starter.frothy`,
  `docs/adr/121-workshop-base-image-board-library-surface.md`, and
  `docs/guide/Frothy_Workshop_Install_Quickstart.md`.
- [x] Minimal docs front door and quick reference
  Deliverable: install, first connect, inspection, board API, persistence, and
  troubleshooting docs that point at the maintained Frothy path.
  References: `README.md`, `docs/guide/Frothy_From_The_Ground_Up.md`,
  `docs/guide/Frothy_Workshop_Quick_Reference.md`, and
  `tools/vscode/README.md`.
- [ ] Clean-machine validation on promised platforms
  Deliverable: prove the attendee path on at least macOS Apple Silicon, macOS
  Intel, and Linux x86_64 before the workshop.
  Note: the exact checklist and recording sheet are now frozen in
  `docs/guide/Frothy_Workshop_Clean_Machine_Validation.md`; the actual
  machine-by-machine passes remain open.
  References: `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `README.md`,
  `docs/guide/Frothy_Workshop_Clean_Machine_Validation.md`, and the workshop
  install path above.
- [ ] Classroom hardware and recovery kit
  Deliverable: preflashed boards, known-good data cables, spare hardware,
  board labels, and a written reflash/fallback procedure.
  Note: the written room-side pack-out and recovery card now live in
  `boards/esp32-devkit-v4-game-board/WORKSHOP.md`; physical packing and labeling remain
  open.
  References: `tools/frothy/proof_m10_smoke.sh`,
  `docs/archive/proofs/m10_esp32_proof_transcript.txt`, `boards/`, and
  `boards/esp32-devkit-v4-game-board/WORKSHOP.md`.
- [ ] Workshop operational closeout
  Deliverable: execute and record the remaining clean-machine validation,
  room-side hardware/recovery prep, and one complete real-device rehearsal on
  the maintained workshop path.
  Note: the checklist, room-side recovery card, and rehearsal status note are
  checked in, but the actual clean-machine passes, physical room pack-out, and
  one complete recorded rehearsal remain open.
  References: `docs/guide/Frothy_Workshop_Clean_Machine_Validation.md`,
  `boards/esp32-devkit-v4-game-board/WORKSHOP.md`,
  `docs/roadmap/Frothy_Workshop_Rehearsal_Closeout_2026-04-14.md`,
  `docs/spec/Frothy_Language_Spec_v0_1.md`, and `tools/frothy/`.
- [x] Publishability reset tranche 1: immediate cuts
  Deliverable: after the 2026-04-16 workshop gate is stable, remove tracked
  repo pollution, archive historical proof artifacts out of active tooling,
  and delete daemon-era VS Code residue that is already outside the packaged
  extension path.
  References: `docs/audit/Frothy_Repo_Audit_2026-04.md`,
  `tools/vscode/test/package-smoke.js`, and `Makefile`.
- [x] Publishability reset tranche 2: naming and packaging normalization
  Deliverable: freeze one publishable identity matrix for Frothy, move the
  shipped CLI/install surface to `frothy` and the repo-local checkout build to
  `frothy-cli`, normalize the Go module/import path, and keep any legacy
  compatibility narrow and explicit.
  References: `docs/audit/Frothy_Repo_Audit_2026-04.md`, `README.md`,
  `tools/cli/go.mod`, and `tools/package-release.sh`.
- [x] Publishability reset tranche 3: proof and dependency collapse
  Deliverable: reduce proofs to core local, extended local, hardware-only, and
  release-only tiers; keep Node extension-only; remove Python from release glue
  first; and quarantine any remaining hardware-only Python.
  References: `docs/audit/Frothy_Repo_Audit_2026-04.md`, `Makefile`,
  `tools/frothy/proof.sh`, and `tools/package-firmware-release.sh`.
- [x] Publishability reset tranche 4: runtime boundary tightening
  Deliverable: make the retained Froth substrate set explicit, quarantine
  compatibility shims, and remove false placeholder labeling from kept runtime
  files without starting a speculative rewrite.
  References: `docs/audit/Frothy_Repo_Audit_2026-04.md`,
  `docs/reference/Froth_Substrate_References.md`, and `CMakeLists.txt`.
  Include: migrate the remaining board/project FFI seams off the legacy
  `froth_ffi_entry_t` / `froth_project_bindings` compatibility path, then
  delete the legacy dispatch/install surface once the maintained
  `frothy_ffi_entry_t` path is the only live ABI.
- [x] Publishability reset tranche 5: docs front door and archive pass
  Deliverable: keep one front door, shorten extension docs to extension-owned
  behavior, and archive historical proof evidence and duplicated release prose
  out of active tooling.
  References: `docs/audit/Frothy_Repo_Audit_2026-04.md`, `README.md`,
  `tools/vscode/README.md`, and `docs/archive/`.
- [ ] Deferred workspace/image-flow queue
  Deliverable: keep workspace/image flow deferred and single-sourced in
  `docs/roadmap/Frothy_Workspace_Image_Flow_Tranche_1.md` until it is
  intentionally reprioritized.
  References: Frothy ADR-115 and
  `docs/roadmap/Frothy_Workspace_Image_Flow_Tranche_1.md`.
- [ ] Deferred evaluator frame-arena ownership revisit
  Deliverable: revisit shared evaluator frame-arena ownership only when
  Frothy intentionally grows multiple live runtime instances or another
  re-entrant evaluator owner in one process.
  Note: the first explicit-stack tranche for `CALL`, `IF`, `WHILE`, `SEQ`, and
  required compound evaluation paths is landed on `main`; the maintained
  single-runtime path keeps that explicit stack authoritative, so the
  remaining ownership cleanup is deferred rather than a current workshop
  blocker.

## Queue Rules

- The checkboxes above are the live movable queue.
- Reordering the queue is expected when priorities change.
- If an item needs more than a short description here, add or update its
  reference doc instead of expanding this file into narrative history.
- The dated v0.1 ladder ends at M10. Do not invent fake dated milestones for
  post-`v0.1` work.
