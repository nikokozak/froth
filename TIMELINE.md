# Frothy Timeline

*Last updated: 2026-04-14*

This file is the movable milestone and queue ledger for Frothy.
The roadmap current-state block in
`docs/roadmap/Frothy_Development_Roadmap_v0_1.md` remains the live control
surface.

If this file and the roadmap disagree, the roadmap wins.

## Current Control Snapshot

## Movable Post-v0.1 Queue

The queue below is intentionally movable. Reorder it as priorities change, but
keep each item's description and references so deferral does not erase context.

- [~] Evaluator execution-stack hardening
  Deliverable: accept the execution-stack ADR and land the first explicit
  evaluator-frame tranche so `CALL`, `IF`, `WHILE`, `SEQ`, and nested
  expression evaluation no longer depend on hidden C stack depth.
  References: Frothy ADR-118, Frothy ADR-105,
  `docs/archive/adr/040-cs-trampoline-executor.md`, `src/frothy_eval.c`, and
  `src/froth_vm.h`.
- [ ] Evaluator frame-arena ownership cleanup
  Deliverable: revisit the current file-local bounded explicit evaluator frame
  arena and either replace it with a clearer caller-owned/local ownership path
  or explicitly keep it with proof that the retained design is the narrowest
  safe fit for the maintained single-runtime evaluator.
  Note: review on the first explicit evaluator-frame tranche judged the current
  `frothy_eval_frame_stack` plus base-depth cursor acceptable for now, but
  still worth tracking as maintainability debt once the immediate hardening
  path is stable.
  References: Frothy ADR-118, `src/frothy_eval.c`,
  `tests/frothy_eval_test.c`, and `tools/frothy/proof_eval_stack_budget.sh`.
- [ ] Priority repair: live-shell records must match the landed record surface
  Deliverable: make the prompt-facing shell accept the maintained `record ...`
  forms and keep record definition, construction, field access, inspection,
  and save/restore behavior aligned with the landed parser, evaluator, and
  snapshot record surface.
  Note: current smoke found `record Point [ x, y ]` still failing at the prompt
  with `parse error (108)` despite checked-in parser/eval/snapshot record
  coverage.
  References: Frothy ADR-112, `src/frothy_shell.c`,
  `tests/frothy_parser_test.c`, `tests/frothy_snapshot_test.c`, and
  `docs/spec/Frothy_Language_Spec_vNext.md`.
- [x] Control-surface repair and workshop-prep note
  Deliverable: thin `PROGRESS.md`, movable `TIMELINE.md`, targeted
  `the repo guide`, and one forward-priority note.
  References: Frothy ADR-116 and
  `docs/roadmap/Frothy_Post_v0_1_Priorities_And_Workshop_Prep.md`.
- [x] Workshop install, editor, and recovery surface
  Deliverable: make install, device discovery, connect, interrupt, reconnect,
  and reset-safe send dependable on the maintained Frothy path.
  References: Frothy ADR-110, Frothy ADR-111, Frothy ADR-113,
  `tools/package-release.sh`, and `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
- [x] Inspection-first teaching surface
  Deliverable: make `words`, `see`, `core`, `slotInfo`, and `@` clean enough
  for the workshop exploration and puzzle path.
  References: `docs/spec/Frothy_Language_Spec_v0_1.md`,
  Frothy ADR-107, `docs/spec/Frothy_Language_Spec_vNext.md`, and
  Frothy ADR-114.
- [x] Workshop base-image library and board surface
  Deliverable: define the preflashed workshop base library and the board
  surface for blink, animation, `millis`, ADC, GPIO, and related helpers.
  References: Frothy ADR-108,
  `docs/roadmap/Frothy_M9_Board_FFI_Closeout.md`, and
  `docs/spec/Frothy_Language_Spec_v0_1.md`, Appendix C.
- [x] Readability language tranche: `in prefix`, `cond`, `case`, and ordinary-code `@`
  Deliverable: land the narrow language additions that most improve workshop
  code and small-library readability without reopening the slot/image model.
  References: Frothy ADR-112, `docs/spec/Frothy_Language_Spec_vNext.md`,
  `docs/spec/Frothy_Surface_Syntax_Proposal_vNext.md`, and Frothy ADR-114.
- [x] Records for workshop/game objects
  Deliverable: add fixed-layout records for workshop and game-object use
  without widening Frothy into dynamic object bags.
  References: Frothy ADR-112, `docs/spec/Frothy_Language_Spec_vNext.md`, and
  Frothy ADR-114.
- [x] Workshop-tranche safety closeout
  Deliverable: fix tranche-local regressions, rerun the proof ladder, and stop
  only after repeated review passes stop surfacing major findings.
  References: `make test`, `make test-cli-local`, `make test-integration`, and
  `make test-all`.
- [x] Support matrix and release/install artifacts
  Deliverable: freeze the promised attendee matrix in-repo and keep the CLI
  plus VSIX install path truthful.
  References: `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `tools/package-release.sh`,
  `tools/vscode/README.md`, `README.md`, and
  `docs/guide/Frothy_Workshop_Install_Quickstart.md`.
- [x] Attendee-facing naming alignment
  Deliverable: ship one explicit transitional story for Frothy versus
  `froth` / `froth-cli` so attendees do not bounce between names during the
  workshop path.
  References: `README.md`, `tools/vscode/README.md`,
  `tools/package-release.sh`, and `tools/cli/Makefile`.
- [x] Attendee install email and quickstart
  Deliverable: one sendable install note that explains the CLI/extension split,
  supported platforms, serial expectations, and the first-run path.
  References: `README.md`,
  `docs/guide/Frothy_Workshop_Install_Quickstart.md`,
  `tools/vscode/README.md`, and `docs/guide/Frothy_From_The_Ground_Up.md`.
- [x] Workshop preflight and serial recovery path
  Deliverable: a clean preflight path for CLI presence, extension
  compatibility, serial visibility, board handshake, and fallback recovery on
  the maintained Frothy path.
  References: `tools/cli/cmd/doctor.go`,
  `tools/cli/internal/serial/discover.go`,
  `tools/vscode/src/control-session-client.ts`,
  `tools/frothy/proof_f1_control_smoke.sh`, and
  `tools/frothy/proof_m10_smoke.sh`.
- [x] Workshop starter project and frozen board/game surface
  Deliverable: one sanctioned project folder and one sanctioned lesson/game
  surface for the workshop path, proved through the maintained host and board
  ladders.
  References: `tools/cli/cmd/new.go`,
  `tools/cli/internal/project/starter.go`,
  `tools/frothy/proof_m10_smoke.sh`,

  `docs/adr/117-workshop-base-image-board-library-surface.md`, and
  `docs/guide/Frothy_Workshop_Install_Quickstart.md`.
- [x] Minimal docs front door and quick reference
  Deliverable: install, first connect, inspection, board API, persistence, and
  troubleshooting docs that point at the maintained Frothy path.
  References: `README.md`, `docs/guide/Frothy_From_The_Ground_Up.md`,
  `docs/guide/Frothy_Workshop_Quick_Reference.md`, and
  `tools/vscode/README.md`.
- [ ] Clean-machine validation on promised platforms
  Deliverable: prove the attendee path on at least macOS Apple Silicon, macOS
  Intel, and Linux x86_64 before the workshop.
  Note: the exact checklist and recording sheet are now frozen in
  `docs/guide/Frothy_Workshop_Clean_Machine_Validation.md`; the actual
  machine-by-machine passes remain open.
  References: `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `README.md`,
  `docs/guide/Frothy_Workshop_Clean_Machine_Validation.md`, and the workshop
  install path above.
- [ ] Classroom hardware and recovery kit
  Deliverable: preflashed boards, known-good data cables, spare hardware,
  board labels, and a written reflash/fallback procedure.
  Note: the written room-side pack-out and recovery card now live in
  `boards/esp32-devkit-v1/WORKSHOP.md`; physical packing and labeling remain
  open.
  References: `tools/frothy/proof_m10_smoke.sh`,
  `docs/archive/proofs/m10_esp32_proof_transcript.txt`, `boards/`, and
  `boards/esp32-devkit-v1/WORKSHOP.md`.
- [~] Workshop rehearsal plus measured performance/persistence closeout
  Deliverable: run the real lesson path end to end, verify loop cadence,
  sensor flow, and `save` / `restore` / `dangerous.wipe`, and freeze the take-home path.
  Note: the branch-local rehearsal status note and proof command are checked
  in, but the measured real-device closeout itself remains open until one
  complete pass is captured and recorded.
  References: `docs/roadmap/F1_Runtime_Hardening_Benchmark_Notes.md`,
  `docs/spec/Frothy_Language_Spec_v0_1.md`, `tools/frothy/`,
  `docs/roadmap/Frothy_Workshop_Rehearsal_Closeout_2026-04-14.md`, and the
  starter project above.
- [ ] Publishability reset tranche 1: immediate cuts
  Deliverable: after the 2026-04-16 workshop gate is stable, remove tracked
  repo pollution, archive historical proof artifacts out of active tooling,
  and delete daemon-era VS Code residue that is already outside the packaged
  extension path.
  References: `docs/audit/Frothy_Repo_Audit_2026-04.md`,
  `tools/vscode/test/package-smoke.js`, and `Makefile`.
- [ ] Publishability reset tranche 2: naming and packaging normalization
  Deliverable: freeze one publishable identity matrix for Frothy versus
  transitional `froth` / `froth-cli`, normalize the Go module/import path, and
  keep any installed-binary rename separate if it is still too risky.
  References: `docs/audit/Frothy_Repo_Audit_2026-04.md`, `README.md`,
  `tools/cli/go.mod`, and `tools/package-release.sh`.
- [ ] Publishability reset tranche 3: proof and dependency collapse
  Deliverable: reduce proofs to core local, extended local, hardware-only, and
  release-only tiers; keep Node extension-only; remove Python from release glue
  first; and quarantine any remaining hardware-only Python.
  References: `docs/audit/Frothy_Repo_Audit_2026-04.md`, `Makefile`,
  `tools/frothy/proof.sh`, and `tools/package-firmware-release.sh`.
- [ ] Publishability reset tranche 4: runtime boundary tightening
  Deliverable: make the retained Froth substrate set explicit, quarantine
  compatibility shims, and remove false placeholder labeling from kept runtime
  files without starting a speculative rewrite.
  References: `docs/audit/Frothy_Repo_Audit_2026-04.md`,
  `docs/reference/Froth_Substrate_References.md`, and `CMakeLists.txt`.
  Include: migrate the remaining board/project FFI seams off the legacy
  `froth_ffi_entry_t` / `froth_project_bindings` compatibility path, then
  delete the legacy dispatch/install surface once the maintained
  `frothy_ffi_entry_t` path is the only live ABI.
- [ ] Publishability reset tranche 5: docs front door and archive pass
  Deliverable: keep one front door, shorten extension docs to extension-owned
  behavior, and archive historical proof evidence and duplicated release prose
  out of active tooling.
  References: `docs/audit/Frothy_Repo_Audit_2026-04.md`, `README.md`,
  `tools/vscode/README.md`, and `docs/archive/`.
- [ ] Deferred workspace/image-flow queue
  Deliverable: keep workspace/image flow deferred and single-sourced in
  `docs/roadmap/Frothy_Workspace_Image_Flow_Tranche_1.md` until it is
  intentionally reprioritized.
  References: Frothy ADR-115 and
  `docs/roadmap/Frothy_Workspace_Image_Flow_Tranche_1.md`.

## Queue Rules

- The checkboxes above are the live movable queue.
- Reordering the queue is expected when priorities change.
- If an item needs more than a short description here, add or update its
  reference doc instead of expanding this file into narrative history.
- The dated v0.1 ladder ends at M10. Do not invent fake dated milestones for
  post-`v0.1` work.

## Worktree Guidance

- Do not reach for a worktree by default for the pre-workshop queue. The
  attendee install, naming-alignment, preflight, starter, and docs cuts should
  normally land from the main checkout unless there are parallel owners making
  conflicting edits.
- Use a dedicated worktree for multi-day post-workshop publishability-reset
  tranches that touch many files or many subsystems at once. The clearest
  candidates are naming/module-path normalization, proof/dependency collapse,
  runtime-boundary tightening, and the docs/archive pass.
- Use a worktree when you need the workshop hotfix path to stay clean on the
  main checkout while a larger cleanup tranche is in flight elsewhere.
- Do not bother with a worktree for doc-only control-surface edits, one-file
  fixes, or tightly scoped workshop-critical repairs that should land quickly.
- Do not start the aggressive post-workshop tranches in a worktree before the
  2026-04-16 workshop path is stable enough that churn on `main` is no longer
  the higher risk.
