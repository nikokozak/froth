# Frothy Timeline

*Last updated: 2026-04-14*

This file is the movable milestone and queue ledger for Frothy.
The roadmap current-state block in
`docs/roadmap/Frothy_Development_Roadmap_v0_1.md` remains the live control
surface.

If this file and the roadmap disagree, the roadmap wins.

## Current Control Snapshot

- Active milestone: `queued follow-on only`
- Blocked by: none
- Next artifact: attendee install, naming-alignment, and preflight hardening cut across CLI/VSCode release artifacts, serial readiness, and workshop starter materials
- Next proof command: `sh tools/frothy/proof_control_surface_docs.sh`

## Closed v0.1 Ladder

  `tools/frothy/m10_esp32_proof_transcript.txt`.

## Movable Post-v0.1 Queue

The queue below is intentionally movable. Reorder it as priorities change, but
keep each item's description and references so deferral does not erase context.

- [x] Control-surface repair and workshop-prep note
  Deliverable: thin `PROGRESS.md`, movable `TIMELINE.md`, targeted
  `the repo guide`, and one forward-priority note.
  References: Frothy ADR-116 and
  `docs/roadmap/Frothy_Post_v0_1_Priorities_And_Workshop_Prep.md`.
- [x] Workshop install, editor, and recovery surface
  Deliverable: make install, device discovery, connect, interrupt, reconnect,
  and reset-safe send dependable on the maintained Frothy path.
  References: Frothy ADR-110, Frothy ADR-111, Frothy ADR-113,
  `tools/package-release.sh`, and `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
- [x] Inspection-first teaching surface
  Deliverable: make `words`, `see`, `core`, `slotInfo`, and `@` clean enough
  for the workshop exploration and puzzle path.
  References: `docs/spec/Frothy_Language_Spec_v0_1.md`,
  Frothy ADR-107, `docs/spec/Frothy_Language_Spec_vNext.md`, and
  Frothy ADR-114.
- [x] Workshop base-image library and board surface
  Deliverable: define the preflashed workshop base library and the board
  surface for blink, animation, `millis`, ADC, GPIO, and related helpers.
  References: Frothy ADR-108,
  `docs/roadmap/Frothy_M9_Board_FFI_Closeout.md`, and
  `docs/spec/Frothy_Language_Spec_v0_1.md`, Appendix C.
- [x] Readability language tranche: `in prefix`, `cond`, `case`, and ordinary-code `@`
  Deliverable: land the narrow language additions that most improve workshop
  code and small-library readability without reopening the slot/image model.
  References: Frothy ADR-112, `docs/spec/Frothy_Language_Spec_vNext.md`,
  `docs/spec/Frothy_Surface_Syntax_Proposal_vNext.md`, and Frothy ADR-114.
- [x] Records for workshop/game objects
  Deliverable: add fixed-layout records for workshop and game-object use
  without widening Frothy into dynamic object bags.
  References: Frothy ADR-112, `docs/spec/Frothy_Language_Spec_vNext.md`, and
  Frothy ADR-114.
- [x] Workshop-tranche safety closeout
  Deliverable: fix tranche-local regressions, rerun the proof ladder, and stop
  only after repeated review passes stop surfacing major findings.
  References: `make test`, `make test-cli-local`, `make test-integration`, and
  `make test-all`.
- [ ] Support matrix and release/install artifacts
  Deliverable: freeze the promised platforms and publish a truthful CLI plus
  VSIX install path for attendees.
  References: `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `tools/package-release.sh`,
  `tools/vscode/README.md`, and `README.md`.
- [ ] Attendee-facing naming alignment
  Deliverable: converge the workshop-facing product, CLI, extension, and docs
  story so attendees do not bounce between Frothy, `froth`, and `froth-cli`;
  if a full rename is too risky, ship one explicit transitional story instead.
  References: `README.md`, `tools/vscode/README.md`,
  `tools/package-release.sh`, and `tools/cli/Makefile`.
- [ ] Attendee install email and quickstart
  Deliverable: one sendable install note that explains the CLI/extension split,
  supported platforms, serial expectations, and the first-run path.
  References: `README.md`, `tools/vscode/README.md`, and
  `docs/guide/Frothy_From_The_Ground_Up.md`.
- [ ] Workshop preflight and serial recovery path
  Deliverable: a clean preflight path for CLI presence, extension
  compatibility, serial visibility, board handshake, and fallback recovery.
  References: `tools/cli/cmd/doctor.go`,
  `tools/cli/internal/serial/discover.go`, and
  `tools/vscode/src/control-session-client.ts`.
- [ ] Workshop starter project and frozen board/game surface
  Deliverable: one sanctioned project folder and one sanctioned board/display
  API for the workshop lesson arc.
  References: `tools/cli/cmd/new.go`, `tools/frothy/`,
  `boards/esp32-devkit-v1/`, and
  `docs/adr/117-workshop-base-image-board-library-surface.md`.
- [ ] Minimal docs front door and quick reference
  Deliverable: install, first connect, inspection, board API, persistence, and
  troubleshooting docs that point at the maintained Frothy path.
  References: `README.md`, `docs/guide/Frothy_From_The_Ground_Up.md`, and
  `tools/vscode/README.md`.
- [ ] Clean-machine validation on promised platforms
  Deliverable: prove the attendee path on at least macOS Apple Silicon, macOS
  Intel, and Linux x86_64 before the workshop.
  References: `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `README.md`, and the workshop
  install path above.
- [ ] Classroom hardware and recovery kit
  Deliverable: preflashed boards, known-good data cables, spare hardware,
  board labels, and a written reflash/fallback procedure.
  References: `tools/frothy/proof_m10_smoke.sh`,
  `tools/frothy/m10_esp32_proof_transcript.txt`, and `boards/`.
- [ ] Workshop rehearsal plus measured performance/persistence closeout
  Deliverable: run the real lesson path end to end, verify loop cadence,
  sensor flow, and `save` / `restore` / `wipe`, and freeze the take-home path.
  References: `docs/roadmap/F1_Runtime_Hardening_Benchmark_Notes.md`,
  `docs/spec/Frothy_Language_Spec_v0_1.md`, `tools/frothy/`, and the starter
  project above.
- [ ] Host-only slot-bundle inspection/generation in the CLI project layer
  Deliverable: the first workspace/image-flow implementation cut only, after
  the workshop-critical tranches above are stable.
  References: Frothy ADR-115 and
  `docs/roadmap/Frothy_Workspace_Image_Flow_Tranche_1.md`.
- [ ] Later workspace/image-flow apply/load growth
  Deliverable: only after host-only inspection/generation proves useful; still
  no registry, daemon, or loader-first detour.
  References: Frothy ADR-115 and
  `docs/roadmap/Frothy_Workspace_Image_Flow_Tranche_1.md`.

## Queue Rules

- The checkboxes above are the live movable queue.
- Reordering the queue is expected when priorities change.
- If an item needs more than a short description here, add or update its
  reference doc instead of expanding this file into narrative history.
- The dated v0.1 ladder ends at M10. Do not invent fake dated milestones for
  post-`v0.1` work.
